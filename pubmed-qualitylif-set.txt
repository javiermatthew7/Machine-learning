TI  - Quality of life assessment in radiotherapy.
PG  - 25-31
LID - 10.48095/ccko202525 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The patient's quality of life is an integral part of the evaluation 
      of anticancer treatment. We can meet its evaluation mainly within the framework 
      of clinical studies and research projects, but it is increasingly included in 
      routine clinical practice as well. In radiotherapy, this indicator needs to be 
      evaluated especially with the advent of new fractionation regimes, which are 
      supposed to ensure better clinical results, but also the same or better quality 
      of life for patients compared to another fractionation scheme. There are several 
      ways to measurably evaluate the quality of life. Questionnaires filled in by 
      patients are most often used, so this is a subjective approach. It is essential 
      to choose the right methodology, especially the type and form of questionnaires 
      with regard to the specific situation (diagnosis, treatment, etc.). AIM: In this 
      educational review article, quality of life and its role in the treatment of a 
      patient with radiotherapy are defined. Next, selected methods of quality of life 
      assessment in radiotherapy are described in detail. Emphasis is placed especially 
      on available questionnaire surveys, generic or specific. Among the most commonly 
      used quality of life questionnaires are those from the EORTC group, FACIT 
      questionnaires and the EQ-5D, SF-36, WHOQOL-100 and WHOQOL-BREF questionnaires. 
      The general EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, which is also often used in 
      radiotherapy, is used to demonstrate the assessment on one specific example of a 
      questionnaire completed by a patient. CONCLUSION: The quality of life of an 
      oncology patient ranks among the most important evaluations of care outcomes 
      (patient reported outcomes measures), and data collection for its evaluation 
      should be part of routine clinical practice in radiation oncology as well, 
      especially when introducing a new fractionation regimen. The purpose of this 
      educational review article is to point out the various possibilities for 
      evaluating the quality of life, different types of generic and specific 
      questionnaires, and also to emphasize certain recommendations and procedures 
      necessary for quality evaluation of questionnaires.

AB  - In the next 15 years, expected increase in incidence of glaucoma is predicted. 
      The glaucoma results in changes of quality of life of patients deteriorating in 
      parallel with progression of stage of disease. The presence of many concomitant 
      diseases in patients has significant impact on survival, exacerbations. 
      hospitalizations and quality of life of patients. The impact of glaucoma on 
      implementation of everyday human activities determines relevance of studying 
      issues of quality of life. The physical state of health level of males is lower 
      than that of females. The vision of both eyes is higher in males than in females. 
      The overall assessment of vision in case of glaucoma causes pronounced decrease 
      in visual function both in males and females. The most patients with glaucoma 
      suffer with decrease in performance and restriction of work. The irritation 
      occurs especially in males and females have uncomfortable relationships due to 
      eye pain and less housework due to vision problems. The overall assessment of 
      vision in case of glaucoma causes violation of visual perception. The social and 
      psychological components affecting quality of life are violated that affects both 
      mental and physical health.

TI  - The Quality in Quality of Life in Parkinson's Disease: A Qualitative 
      Meta-Synthesis.
PG  - 761-769
LID - 10.1002/mdc3.14063 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quality of life (QoL) is known to be impaired in people with 
      Parkinson's disease (PwPD). Not surprisingly, a considerable effort of health 
      interventions is aimed at maintaining or improving QoL. Yet, little is known 
      about its determinants from a PwPD perspective to inform person-centered health 
      care interventions. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aims to overcome this 
      information gap by synthesizing existing evidence on factors associated with 
      PwPD' self-perceived QoL. METHODS: We searched six electronic databases (MEDLINE, 
      EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Library) from inception to 
      January 2022 for eligible qualitative studies of QoL in PwPD, supplemented by 
      citation tracking and hand searching. Study quality was assessed using the 
      QualSyst tool. In order to characterize the determinants of QoL in PwPD, we 
      conducted a qualitative meta-synthesis. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed a wide 
      range of facilitators and barriers to QoL relating to seven overarching themes: 
      Illness experience, health care, everyday life, social life, identity, 
      spirituality/religion, and environment. CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review 
      reinforces the impact of symptom experience on PwPD's QoL. However, it also 
      highlights the need to consider the non-physical dimensions of PD when assessing 
      patients' QoL. It is therefore essential that health care professionals 
      acknowledge the psychological, social and spiritual repercussions of PD and 
      endeavor to respond to these concerns through a comprehensive and 
      patient-centered strategy. Further research is needed to gain a deeper 
      understanding of these facets of PD and to formulate successful interventions 
      aimed at improving the QoL of PwPD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the long-term health outcomes of neonates affected by 
      necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and its implications for quality of life. DATA 
      SOURCE: This is an integrative review, conducted by searching the literature in 
      the following databases: Virtual Health Library (BVS), Latin American and 
      Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), Medical Literature Analysis and 
      Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), and PubMed, using Health Sciences Descriptors 
      (DeCS): "necrotizing enterocolitis," "quality of life," and "prognosis" combined 
      with the Boolean operators AND and OR: "quality of life" OR "prognosis." 
      Inclusion criteria were: publication period between 2012 and 2022. DATA 
      SYNTHESIS: A total of 1,010 studies were located, of which ten were selected to 
      comprise the bibliographic sample of this review. Children with NEC are prone to 
      exhibit cognitive neurological impairment, especially those who undergo surgical 
      procedures due to more severe conditions. Motor development was considered below 
      average when compared to healthy children, with more noticeable delays in fine 
      and gross motor function development. The search for the relationship between NEC 
      and quality of life revealed that this condition has a negative impact on the 
      well-being of affected individuals. CONCLUSIONS: NEC has proven to be a serious 
      condition contributing to high rates of morbidity and mortality in newborns, 
      potentially leading to a reduction in the quality of life of affected patients.

TI  - Global quality of life and mortality risk in patients with cancer: a systematic

AB  - PURPOSE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the impact of 
      global quality of life (QOL) on mortality risk in patients with cancer, 
      considering cancer type and timepoint of QOL assessment. METHODS: A systematic 
      search was conducted using Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health 
      Literature, PubMed/MEDLINE, and Scopus databases from inception to December 2022. 
      Observational studies that assessed QOL and examined mortality risk in patients 
      with cancer were extracted. Subgroup analyses were performed for cancer types and 
      timepoints of QOL assessment. RESULTS: Overall, global QOL was significantly 
      associated with mortality risk (hazard ratio: 1.06, 95% confidence interval: 
      1.05-1.07; p < 0.00001). A subgroup analysis based on cancer type demonstrated 
      that lung, head and neck, breast, esophagus, colon, prostate, hematologic, liver, 
      gynecologic, stomach, brain, bladder, bone and soft tissue, and mixed type 
      cancers were significantly associated with mortality risk; however, melanoma and 
      pancreatic cancer were not significantly associated with mortality risk. 
      Additionally, global QOL was associated with mortality risk at all timepoints 
      (pretreatment, posttreatment, and palliative phase); pretreatment QOL had the 
      largest impact, followed by posttreatment QOL. CONCLUSION: These findings provide 
      evidence that QOL is associated with mortality risk in patients with cancer at 
      any timepoint. These results indicate the importance of evaluating the QOL and 
      supportive interventions to improve QOL in any phase.

TI  - Periodontitis and Oral Health-Related Quality of Life: A Systematic Review and 
      Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 408-420
LID - 10.1111/jcpe.14074 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the association between periodontitis and oral health-related 
      quality of life (OHRQoL) in adults, and to compare OHRQoL across different 
      severities of the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Searches were conducted in five 
      electronic databases up to December 2023. Observational studies that provided a 
      clear definition of periodontitis and used validated measures of OHRQoL were 
      included. Meta-analyses were performed both overall and based on factors that 
      could explain heterogeneity between studies. RESULTS: Sixty studies comprising 
      14,851 individuals were included in the review. Meta-analyses showed that 
      periodontitis was associated with impaired OHRQoL: any OHRQoL instruments (n = 33 
      studies; SMD: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.53-0.93), solely using the OHIP-14 (n = 26 studies; 
      MD: 5.14, 95% CI: 3.64-6.64), and risk assessment (n = 9 studies; adjusted RR: 
      1.42, 95% CI: 1.12-1.78). Stages III-IV periodontitis had a greater impact than 
      Stages I-II periodontitis. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses indicated 
      smaller effect size estimates for individuals with comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Periodontitis negatively impacts OHRQoL, with a positive score-response 
      relationship found between periodontitis severity and poorer OHRQoL. However, the 
      magnitude of this association appears to be diminished in individuals with 
      comorbidities.

TI  - The quality of life of men experiencing infertility: a systematic review.
PG  - 1236
LID - 10.1186/s12889-024-18758-6 [doi]
LID - 1236
AB  - BACKGROUND: Men experiencing infertility encounter numerous problems at the 
      individual, family, and social levels as well as quality of life (QOL). This 
      study was designed to investigate the QOL of men experiencing infertility through 
      a systematic review. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This systematic review was conducted 
      without any time limitation (Retrieval date: July 1, 2023) in international 
      databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar. The search 
      was performed by two reviewers separately using keywords such as QOL, 
      infertility, and men. Studies were selected based on inclusion and exclusion 
      criteria. The quality of the articles were evaluated based on the 
      Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. In the initial search, 308 studies were reviewed, and 
      after removing duplicates and checking the title and abstract, the full text of 
      87 studies were evaluated. RESULTS: Finally, 24 studies were included in the 
      final review based on the research objectives. Based on the results, men's QOL 
      scores in different studies varied from 55.15 ± 13.52 to 91.45 ± 13.66%. Of the 
      total reviewed articles, the lowest and highest scores were related to mental 
      health problems and physical dimensions, respectively. CONCLUSION: The reported 
      findings vary across various studies conducted in different countries. Analysis 
      of the factors affecting these differences is necessary, and it is recommended to 
      design a standard tool for assessing the quality of life of infertile men. Given 
      the importance of the QOL in men experiencing infertility, it is crucial to 
      consider it in the health system. Moreover, a plan should be designed, 
      implemented and evaluated according to each country's contex to improve the 
      quality of life of infertile men.

TI  - Quality of life in patients with acquired dermal macular hyperpigmentation: a 
      systematic review.
PG  - 1504-1509
LID - 10.1093/ced/llae224 [doi]
AB  - Acquired dermal macular hyperpigmentation (ADMH) encompasses conditions including 
      lichen planus pigmentosus, erythema dyschromicum perstans, ashy dermatosis, Riehl 
      melanosis and pigmented contact dermatitis. This group of cosmetically 
      distressing pigmentary disorders poses a therapeutic challenge, yet to our 
      knowledge, there have been no systematic reviews published that describe their 
      impact on quality of life (QoL). An electronic database search of PubMed, Embase, 
      PsycINFO and Cochrane Library was performed in December 2022 to search for 
      articles published from inception until 15 December 2022. Articles were included 
      if they (i) were a primary clinical publication, (ii) reported QoL in patients 
      with ADMH, and (iii) were available in full text. Overall, the review highlighted 
      a considerable gap in the literature concerning the impact of ADMH on QoL. Seven 
      studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included, with a total of 259 
      patients. All seven studies reported impaired QoL in patients with ADMH. The 
      currently available literature on this topic indicates that ADMH has a 
      significant adverse impact on QoL, likely to a greater degree than melasma, and 
      to a similar or lesser degree than vitiligo. Five of seven studies reported the 
      QoL impairment for patients with ADMH based on the Dermatology Life Quality Index 
      (DLQI); these studies consistently found a mean DLQI score reflective of a 
      moderate effect on patients' QoL. Clinicians must be aware of the significant 
      psychosocial burden associated with ADMH. This impact is often overlooked but 
      should be considered when taking a holistic approach to management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inborn Errors of Immunity (IEI) significantly affect patients' 
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL), presenting greater challenges than those 
      faced by the healthy population and other chronic disease sufferers. Current 
      research lacks comprehensive integration of this critical issue. OBJECTIVE: This 
      study explores HRQOL in IEI patients, identifies impacting factors, and advocates 
      for increased research focus on their quality of life. METHODS: Following 
      systematic review and meta-analysis guidelines, a search of Scopus and PubMed 
      until November 15, 2023, yielded 1633 publications. We evaluated the literature, 
      assessed study quality, and compared the HRQOL of IEI patients to that of healthy 
      individuals and other chronic disease patients. RESULTS: Of 90 articles and 
      10,971 IEI patients analyzed, study quality varied (nine good, 63 moderate, and 
      18 poor). The Short Form-36 (SF-36) and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 
      generic core scales (PedsQL) were the primary generic instruments used among 
      adults and children, respectively, with 12 studies each using the 
      disease-specific instruments. Meta-analysis showed IEI patients have 
      significantly lower scores in general health, physical and mental health, and 
      social and emotional roles compared to healthy populations. We noted significant 
      differences between self and proxy reports, indicating caregiver anxiety and 
      perception disparities. CONCLUSION: Despite limitations like small sample sizes 
      and reliance on generic instruments, this research underscores the substantially 
      lower HRQOL among IEI patients, emphasizing the need for a patient-centered, 
      multidisciplinary approach to improve their life quality and calling for more 
      focused attention on IEI patients and their caregivers' HRQOL.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Quality of life (QoL) is a common indicator of outcomes in people 
      living with diabetes, but the concept of diabetes-related QoL (DRQoL) remains 
      unclear. Clarifying core knowledge of DRQoL was the goal of this paper. METHODS: 
      A concept analysis was conducted according to Walker and Avant's framework. A 
      systematic search of the published literature was conducted between 2002 and 2022 
      based on resource availability, current relevancy, and the quality of recent 
      studies. Three major databases were used to identify the attributes, antecedents, 
      consequences, and measures for DRQoL. Only articles investigating DRQoL among 
      adult or elderly people living with diabetes that were published in English in 
      peer-reviewed journals were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 4342 articles were 
      screened, and only 401 articles underwent eligibility assessment. A total of 183 
      articles were included in the analysis. Most (59.78%) of them were observational 
      studies and DRQoL as a primary outcome. We identified four critical components of 
      DRQoL: (a) general health, (b) diabetes-related satisfaction, (c) diabetes 
      impact, and (d) diabetes self-management. The antecedents were classified 
      according to their contributions to DRQoL as follows: 25 positive-induced, 4 
      neutral-based, and 19 negative-induced antecedents. The consequences of DRQoL 
      were mortality risk, personal health, satisfaction with health care, 
      hospitalization risk, and failure to return to work. The referents varied widely, 
      and 32 tools were found for DRQoL measurement. Furthermore, 12 scales for 
      disease-specific DRQoL and 17 tools for general QoL were identified. CONCLUSION: 
      This paper provides a definition of DRQoL as well as its attributes, antecedents, 
      consequences, and measures in adults with diabetes. The attributes of DRQoL 
      included general health, diabetes-related satisfaction, diabetes impact, and 
      diabetes self-management. A comprehensive understanding of DRQoL can improve the 
      quality of care and can aid in the recognition of the needs of care among people 
      living with diabetes.

AB  - Nowadays, chronic diseases are more common and affect a huge number of 
      individuals. They can have a negative impact on the quality of life in many 
      domains, including physical well-being, mental health and social relationships. 
      This systematic narrative synthesis aims to explore health-related quality of 
      life in people with chronic diseases in Africa. Using appropriate keywords, 
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, and an in-depth examination of bibliographics 
      through Scopus databases were carried out according to the PRISMA chart. Thus, 
      the 23 studies from Africa retained were published in English between January 
      1(st), 2019, and October 14(th), 2023 and they reported the quality of 
      life-related to health in patients living with chronic disease. The results of 
      this review revealed that patients living with chronic diseases suffer from a 
      number of medical, psychological, and social factors that have a negative impact 
      on their quality of life. This study highlighted the importance of giving 
      patients with chronic diseases in Africa top priority when they come to health 
      care services and it pointed out the need to bolster Africa's health systems by 
      improving primary care and similarly by increasing the knowledge and skills of 
      care staff to enhance health-related quality of life of these patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Disease-focus management of late-stage cancer without addressing 
      patients' preferences or quality of life (QoL) can lead to unsatisfactory patient 
      and disease outcomes. METHODS: A PRISMA-adherent systematic review of the 
      literature was conducted via PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar to assess 
      the current late-stage cancer treatment modality, setting, timing, and cost, 
      their impact on patient and disease outcomes, and possible interventions for 
      improvement. RESULTS: Out of many studies, twelve from North America, Western 
      Europe, and Asia met our inclusion criteria. A detailed analysis of the 929,408 
      late-stage cancer patients included revealed common management practices. 
      Typically, patients were subjected to sustained intensive disease-focused 
      treatment through the end-of-life (EoL) while deferring palliative care and other 
      host-sustaining measures. Such practices compromised patients' QoL and increased 
      costs without meeting their needs and expectations or significantly altering the 
      course of the disease. To forestall such practices, five pragmatic host-focused 
      management principles are proposed. In contrast to clinical practice guidelines 
      (CPG), they can be promoted directly to current and future cancer care 
      professionals as an easy-to-memorize and apply template: to the former via 
      continuing medical education, podcasts, webinars, and other tutorials; to the 
      latter by its incorporation into Oncology, Hematology, Hospice, and other 
      cancer-training programs. CONCLUSIONS: Despite major advances in early-stage 
      cancer treatment and survival, late-stage cancer care is hindered by continuous 
      disease-focused practices pursued through the EoL that lead to unsatisfactory 
      patient and disease outcomes. Such practices can be reversed by adopting 
      host-focused management principles that promote QoL and meet patients' needs and 
      expectations as a basis for delivering holistic cancer care through the EoL.

AB  - Peripheral artery disease (PAD) patients experience low utility, especially those 
      having undergone amputation. Utility is one of the quality weights of health 
      status, converted from quality of life (QOL). This study aimed to systematically 
      review published literature and analyze a pooled estimate of utility in PAD 
      patients. The following databases were queried for articles published from 
      inception up to August 30, 2022: PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, ThaiJo, and the 
      Thai thesis database. Four quality assessment tools were used, tailored to each 
      study's design. A pooled utility was estimated by the random effect and reported 
      using Rutherford and Fontaine classification systems due to their common use in 
      practice. The protocol was registered with the International Prospective 
      Registration of Systematic Reviews (CRD42023392775). Fourteen high-quality 
      studies were included, pooling utility from 3,664 PAD patients. The pooled 
      utility by the Rutherford categories was 0.67, with scores for categories 0, 1-3, 
      4, and 5 being 0.88, 0.65, 0.68, and 0.58, respectively. The pooled utility by 
      the Fontaine stage was 0.68, with stages 1, 2, 3, and 4 scoring 0.88, 0.65, 0.67, 
      and 0.58, respectively. PAD utility is comparable to that of other chronic 
      diseases. The pooled utility could be a valuable parameter for cost-utility 
      analysis in PAD management.

AB  - Atopic dermatitis is an inflammatory skin condition that largely affects 
      children. Atopic dermatitis has the potential to persist into adulthood and 
      continue to negatively affect the lives of those who are burdened with it. This 
      condition can have a large impact on the quality of life of those who are 
      affected from birth through senescence. Scoring systems have been developed over 
      time to help assess the impact that AD has on an individual's quality of life. 
      The goal of this article is to create an overview of the quality of life scores 
      by age group and across nationalities.

TI  - Quality of life among people living with mental illness and predictors in Africa: 
      a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1191-1209
LID - 10.1007/s11136-023-03525-8 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Quality of life (QoL) of patients with mental illness has been 
      examined internationally but to a lesser extent in developing countries, 
      including countries in Africa. Improving QoL is vital to reducing disability 
      among people with mental illness. Therefore, this systematic review and 
      meta-analysis aimed to assess the prevalence of QoL and associated factors among 
      people living with mental illness in Africa. METHODS: Using the PICOT approach, 
      Scopus, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase, the Web of Science, and Google Scholar 
      were searched. A structured search was undertaken, comprising terms associated 
      with mental health, mental illness, QoL, and a list of all African countries. The 
      Joanna Briggs Institute Quality Appraisal Checklist is used to evaluate research 
      quality. Subgroup analysis with Country, domains of QoL, and diagnosis was tested 
      using a random-effect model, and bias was assessed using a funnel plot and an 
      inspection of Egger's regression test. A p value, OR, and 95% CI were used to 
      demonstrate an association. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of poor QoL was 45.93% 
      (36.04%, 55.83%), I(2) = 98.6%, p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that 
      Ethiopia (48.09%; 95% CI = 33.73, 62.44), Egypt (43.51%; 95% CI = 21.84, 65.18), 
      and Nigeria (43.49%; 95% CI = 12.25, 74.74) had the highest mean poor QoL 
      prevalence of the countries. The pooled prevalence of poor QoL by diagnosis was 
      as follows: bipolar disorder (69.63%; 95% CI = 47.48, 91.77), Schizophrenia 
      (48.53%; 95% CI = 29.97, 67.11), group of mental illnesses (40.32%; 95% 
      CI = 23.98, 56.66), and depressive disorders (38.90%; 95% CI = 22.98, 54.81). 
      Being illiterate (3.63; 95% CI = 2.35, 4.91), having a comorbid medical illness 
      (4.7; 95% CI = 2.75, 6.66), having a low monthly income (3.62; 95% CI = 1.96, 
      5.27), having positive symptoms (0.32; 95% CI = 0.19, 0.55), and having negative 
      symptoms (0.26; 95% CI = 0.16, 0.43) were predictors of QoL. Thus, some factors 
      are significantly associated with pooled effect estimates of QoL. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The current systematic review and meta-analysis showed that almost half of 
      patients with mental illness had poor QoL. Being illiterate, having a comorbid 
      medical condition, having a low monthly income, having positive symptoms, and 
      having negative symptoms of mental illness were independent predictors of poor 
      QoL. This systematic review and meta-analysis emphasize that poor QoL of people 
      with mental illness in Africa needs attention to reduce its negative 
      consequences.

TI  - Valuing quality of life for economic evaluations in cancer: navigating multiple 
      methods.
PG  - 1101-1114
LID - 10.1080/14737167.2024.2393332 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Utility values offer a quantitative means to evaluate the impact of 
      novel cancer treatments on patients' quality of life (QoL). However, the multiple 
      methods available for valuing QoL present challenges in selecting the most 
      appropriate method across different contexts. AREAS COVERED: This review provides 
      cancer clinicians and researchers with an overview of methods to value QoL for 
      economic evaluations, including standalone and derived preference-based measures 
      (PBMs) and direct preference elicitation methods. Recent developments are 
      described, including the comparative performance of cancer-specific PBMs versus 
      generic PBMs, measurement of outcomes beyond health-related QoL, and increased 
      use of discrete choice experiments to elicit preferences. Recommendations and 
      considerations are provided to guide the choice of method for cancer research. 
      EXPERT OPINION: We foresee continued adoption of the QLU-C10D and FACT-8D in 
      cancer clinical trials given the extensive use of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and FACT-G in 
      cancer research. While these cancer-specific PBMs offer the convenience of 
      eliciting utility values without needing a standalone PBM, researchers should 
      consider potential limitations if they intend to substitute them for generic 
      PBMs. As the field advances, there is a greater need for consensus on the 
      approach to selection and integration of various methods in cancer clinical 
      trials.

TI  - Instruments for the assessment of quality of life in children and adolescents 
      with Down syndrome: a scoping review.
PG  - 688

AB  - The construct of quality of life (QoL) includes aspects of health and well-being 
      of people. Down syndrome [DS] or trisomy 21 is one of the most common congenital 
      anomalies. DS is characterized by motor and cognitive alterations that affect 
      health and QOL of both the child and caregiver.In pediatrics, there are various 
      instruments to assess Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and QoL. The 
      advantage of these instruments is that they can be implemented in any type of 
      disease and population in general. However, they may have certain disadvantages, 
      such as the difficulty in evaluating specific aspects of each disease or 
      condition related to Down syndrome. The aim of this study was to identify 1: 
      instruments used to assess quality of life in children with Down syndrome. 2: 
      psychometrics properties of instruments validated in children with Down syndrome 
      to assess quality of life. Methods A Scoping review was conducted to identify 
      instruments used in children and adolescents with Down syndrome, and a second 
      systematic searched psychometric properties of these instruments. The electronic 
      databases PubMed, Embase, Epistemonikos and other sources were explored with a 
      search strategy that included keywords such as "Down syndrome," "Quality of life" 
      or "Life Quality," "Health-Related Quality of Life" and psychometrics properties. 
      The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the COSMIN (Based 
      Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments) methodology. 
      Results Twenty-seven studies were selected that used twelve instruments to 
      evaluate quality of life in children or adolescents with Down syndrome. Two of 
      the twelve evaluated quality of life and ten health-related quality of life. In 
      the second search, ten studies reported the psychometric properties of six 
      instruments evaluated in minors with Down Syndrome. Conclusion There is limited 
      information available regarding the psychometric properties of instruments used 
      to assess quality of life, particularly health-related quality of life. Commonly 
      employed instruments in this area include the PedsQL 4.0 and KIDSCREEN. Notably, 
      while the PedsQL 4.0 lacks specific evaluation in children with DS, data from 
      KIDSCREEN assessments are inconsistently reported. Rigorous evaluation of the 
      performance of Kidslife and Kidslife Down in clinical settings is necessary, or 
      the development of new instruments tailored for children with DS is warranted to 
      comprehensively assess quality of life in clinical settings.

TI  - Quality of life among obstructive sleep apnoea patients: a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis of EQ-5D studies.
PG  - 621-631
LID - 10.1007/s11136-024-03828-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) is a chronic condition which is 
      associated with extreme daytime sleepiness, cognitive impairment, and other 
      comorbidities and, hence, decreased quality of life (QoL). EQ-5D is one of the 
      most widely used preference-based measures of QoL in patients with different 
      diseases worldwide. This study aims to review the EQ-5D utility value of OSA 
      across primary studies and perform a meta-analysis to derive pooled utility 
      scores for OSA. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the EQ-5D 
      scores of OSA patients adhering to PRISMA guidelines was conducted. Studies 
      reporting EQ-5D utility scores among adult OSA patients were systematically 
      searched across PubMed-Medline, Scopus, and Embase. Selected studies were 
      systematically reviewed and we have assessed the studies for their quality. 
      Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effect model with subgroup analysis to 
      explore heterogeneity. RESULTS: The search yielded 9,121 articles, of which 
      twenty-eight studies were included in the synthesis. The pooled mean EQ-5D 
      utility score was 0.73 (0.69 to 0.78) with high heterogeneity (I(2) = 99.6%). The 
      pooled EQ-5D VAS score was 67.14 (63.97 to 70.32) with high heterogeneity 
      (I(2) = 87.04%). Subgroup analyses indicated significant variability in utility 
      scores across different countries, age groups, and disease severities. The 
      variation of utility values for OSA was influenced by the characteristics of 
      patients, the living environment, and the EQ-5D value set. CONCLUSION: The 
      synthesis revealed that the QoL is significantly lower in OSA, and the aggregated 
      quantitative estimates of EQ-5D utility scores are essential inputs for economic 
      evaluations.

      stage: a narrative literature review.
PG  - 884

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer stage at diagnosis is an important prognostic indicator for 
      patient outcomes, with detection at later stages associated with increased 
      mortality and morbidity. The impact of cancer stage on patient-reported outcomes 
      is poorly understood. This research aimed to understand symptom burden and health 
      related quality of life (HRQoL) impact by cancer stage for ten cancer types: 1) 
      ovarian, 2) lung, 3) pancreatic, 4) esophageal, 5) stomach, 6) head and neck, 7) 
      colorectal, 8) anal, 9) cervical, and 10) liver and bile duct. METHODS: Ten 
      narrative literature reviews were performed to identify and collate published 
      literature on patient burden at different stages of disease progression. 
      Literature searches were conducted using an AI-assisted platform to identify 
      relevant articles published in the last five (2017-2022) or ten years (2012-2022) 
      where articles were limited. Conference abstracts were searched for the last two 
      years (2020-2022). The geographic scope was limited to the United States, Canada, 
      Europe, and global studies, and only journal articles written in English were 
      included. RESULTS: A total of 26 studies with results stratified by cancer stage 
      at diagnosis (and before treatment) were selected for the cancer types of lung, 
      pancreatic, esophageal, stomach, head and neck, colorectal, anal, and cervical 
      cancers. Two cancer types, ovarian cancer, and liver and bile duct cancer did not 
      return any search results with outcomes stratified by disease stage. A general 
      trend was observed for worse patient-reported outcomes in patients with cancer 
      diagnosed at an advanced stage of disease compared with diagnosis at an earlier 
      stage. Advanced disease stage was associated with greater symptom impact 
      including general physical impairments such as pain, fatigue, and interference 
      with functioning, as well as disease/region-specific symptom burden. Poorer HRQoL 
      was also associated with advanced disease with commonly reported symptoms 
      including anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the general trend for 
      greater symptom burden and poorer HRQoL seen in late stage versus early-stage 
      disease across the included cancer types supports the importance for early 
      diagnosis and treatment to improve patient survival and decrease negative impacts 
      on disease burden and HRQoL.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aimed to identify effective components and 
      assess the statistical, practical, and clinical significance of tailored 
      interventions for enhancing cancer survivors' quality of life. METHODS: 
      Twenty-four clinical trials were selected based on search results from five 
      databases. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0, 
      and data were synthesized through qualitative analysis. RESULTS: Most trials 
      focused on post-treatment cancer survivors with a single type of cancer. Tailored 
      interventions included physical activity, nutrition, psychosocial change, and 
      symptom management, utilizing education, counseling, feedback, and monitoring. 
      These interventions improved social and physical aspects of quality of life, as 
      well as overall health status. Remote, iterative tailored interventions 
      positively impacted the social aspects of quality of life for cancer survivors. 
      Interventions incorporating theoretical determinants such as readiness to change 
      and self-efficacy were notably effective in enhancing quality of life. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates that tailored interventions leveraging 
      theoretical determinants to boost motivation and using remote, interactive modes 
      can improve quality of life among cancer survivors. Additional rigorous studies 
      with longer follow-ups are needed to confirm the long-term effects of these 
      interventions. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The findings provide insights into 
      essential intervention components and research approaches for planning tailored 
      interventions to improve quality of life for cancer survivors. Notably, this 
      review identified minimal clinically important differences for a range of quality 
      of life measures specific to cancer survivors.

TI  - Health-related quality of life of people with heart failure in low- and 
      middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1175-1189
LID - 10.1007/s11136-023-03563-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Heart failure is a global health concern and associated with poor 
      health-related quality of life and increased mortality. There is a 
      disproportionate burden on patients and health systems in low- and middle-income 
      countries. This systematic review and meta-analysis estimates the health-related 
      quality of life of people with heart failure in low- and middle-income countries. 
      METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify relevant 
      studies from January 2012 to November 2022 using the following databases: 
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus and JBI EBP database. 
      Study screening, quality appraisal and data extraction were conducted using JBI 
      methodology. A random-effects model was used to perform the meta-analysis. 
      Heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) statistic. All statistical analyses 
      were done in STATA version 17. RESULTS: A total of 33 studies with 5612 
      participants were included in this review. The Minnesota Living with Heart 
      Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) and the Short-Form-36 questionnaire (SF-36) were 
      the most used instruments across 19 and 8 studies, respectively. The pooled mean 
      MLHFQ and SF-36 scores using the random-effects model were 46.08 (95% CI 35.06, 
      57.10) and 41.23 (95% CI 36.63, 45.83), respectively. In a subgroup analysis 
      using both instruments, the highest health-related quality-of-life scores 
      occurred in studies with inpatient participants. CONCLUSION: The overall 
      health-related quality of life of people with heart failure in low- and 
      middle-income countries is poor. Strategies should be strategically developed to 
      improve the health-related quality of life of people with heart failure in these 
      countries. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42022377781.

AB  - PURPOSE: This review aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of Reiki therapy 
      on quality of life. METHODS: The review followed standard scientific journal 
      practices and a systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and 
      the Cochrane Library, with a literature cutoff of September 2024, was conducted 
      to identify relevant studies. Inclusion criteria comprised articles published in 
      English, randomized controlled trials (RCT), Reiki therapy as the independent 
      variable, diverse patient populations, and outcome measures focusing on quality 
      of life improvement. RESULTS: The review involved 661 participants aged 14 years 
      and above, showing a significant enhancement in quality of life post-Reiki 
      therapy (SMD = 0.28, 95% CI 0.01 ~ 0.56, P = 0.043). The subgroup analysis showed 
      that Reiki therapy interventions with a frequency of ≥ 8 sessions and a duration 
      of ≥ 60 min and acute interventions of ≤ 20 min were most effective in improving 
      quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: The existing meta-analysis and systematic review 
      suggested that Reiki therapy positively impacted quality of life. Therefore, it 
      was recommended that patients with cancer, surgical patients, chronic illnesses, 
      and the general population receive acute Reiki therapy sessions (≤ 20 min) or 
      Reiki therapy with sufficient frequency (≥ 8 sessions) and duration (≥ 60 min) to 
      enhance their quality of life. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: Systematic review

TI  - The psychological, social, and quality of life outcomes of people with a cardiac 
      implantable electronic device: an umbrella review.
PG  - 441-451
LID - 10.1093/eurjcn/zvad133 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To synthesize the psychological, social, and quality of life outcomes of 
      people with a cardiac implantable electronic device. METHODS AND RESULTS: An 
      umbrella review of systematic reviews that reported the psychological, social, or 
      quality of life outcomes of adults with a cardiac implantable electronic device 
      was conducted. This umbrella review was pre-registered with PROSPERO 
      (CRD42023437078) and adhered to JBI and PRISMA guidelines. Seven databases 
      (CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Embase, EmCare, PsycINFO, PubMed, and the Web of 
      Science) were searched alongside citation and bibliographic searches. 
      Methodological quality was assessed using the JBI Checklist of Systematic Reviews 
      and Research Syntheses. Due to the heterogeneity of the included reviews, the 
      findings were reported narratively. A total of 14 systematic reviews met the 
      inclusion criteria; 11 considered quality of life outcomes, and 3 considered 
      psychological outcomes. Little difference in quality of life was found between 
      people with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and controls; however, a 
      high prevalence of psychological disorders was present. Cardiac resynchronization 
      therapy devices demonstrated improvements in quality of life compared with 
      control groups, alongside possible cognitive benefits. Quality of life did not 
      differ between subcutaneous and transvenous implantable 
      cardioverter-defibrillators. Pacemakers were associated with improved 
      post-implantation quality of life. CONCLUSION: Research on the psychosocial and 
      quality of life outcomes of people with a cardiac implantable electronic device 
      is limited and inconsistent. Given the heterogeneity of the current research, 
      conclusions are uncertain. Nevertheless, some recipients may experience adverse 
      psychosocial complications. Further research employing rigorous methodologies is 
      needed, and healthcare practitioners should provide care that acknowledges the 
      potential for adverse psychosocial experiences. REGISTRATION: PROSPERO:

AB  - With the development of China's economy entering a new stage, the quality of 
      life, which centers on the well-being of residents, provides an essential hand in 
      promoting the transformation of the regional economy from high-speed development 
      to high-quality development. Based on a panel threshold regression model, we 
      examine in this paper whether quality of life helps regional economies realize 
      developmental convergence. The research shows that: (1) The quality of life 
      overall can promote regional economic development and passes the series test with 
      relatively robust results. (2) The quality of life has a non-linear effect on 
      regional economic growth, which is mainly manifested in the fact that the impact 
      is more significant in regions with higher levels of quality of life and weaker 
      in regions with lagging quality of life and may widen the gap between regions at 
      the same time. (3) We categorize the study regions to test further regional 
      heterogeneity based on regional location and development status. At the Quality 
      of Life Level-I regions, their influence on economic development has a more 
      substantial pulling effect. Therefore, each region should seize the strategic 
      opportunity to improve the quality of life, focus on the balanced development of 
      the quality of life, strengthen policy support and social security, and strive to 
      promote the coordinated development of China's regional economy.

TI  - A qualitative systematic review of the impact of hearing on quality of life.
PG  - 879-892
LID - 10.1007/s11136-024-03851-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Hearing loss, deafness, and other hearing-related conditions can 
      significantly impact quality of life; numerous qualitative studies have sought to 
      describe these impacts. Synthesis of these findings may provide additional or 
      more robust insights. METHODS: A qualitative systematic review of studies 
      reporting qualitative data relating to the impact of hearing problems on adults' 
      health-related quality of life. A subset of studies was included in the review 
      and subsequently analysed using a thematic approach. RESULTS: The literature 
      search yielded 129 studies, of which 22 met our inclusion criteria and were 
      included for analysis. The included studies, primarily from Australia, the UK, 
      and the USA, involved approximately 450 participants with various hearing 
      conditions. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were the most common data 
      collection methods, with thematic analysis being the predominant analytical 
      approach. Three overarching categories of descriptive themes were identified: 
      Physical, Mental, and Social. Physical encompassed sound localization, sound 
      clarity, speech, and physical fatigue. Social included relationships, isolation, 
      communication, independence, work function, social stigma, and confidence. Mental 
      encompassed depression, anxiety, listening effort, mental fatigue, fear, and 
      identity. The identified themes shed light on the diverse domains of 
      health-related quality of life affected by hearing conditions. CONCLUSION: 
      Differences in hearing function impact upon people's health-related quality of 
      life in a variety of ways relating to physical, mental, and social aspects of 
      health, and these themes are clearly demonstrated across qualitative studies. 
      These results will inform the development of hearing-specific questionnaire items 
      for with the EQ-5D descriptive system, a commonly used patient-reported outcome 
      measure.

OAB - Hearing loss, deafness, and other hearing-related conditions can significantly 
      affect a person’s quality of life and well-being. Previous research has 
      investigated in what way and to what extent hearing problems have an impact on 
      adults’ health-related quality of life, which is a concept routinely used to 
      inform the allocation of resources in health care. This study reviews and 
      analyses the findings of previous research to identify aspects of quality of life 
      that are important to people living with hearing conditions. We found that the 
      affected areas of quality of life can be categorized into Physical, Mental, and 
      Social aspects. Physical comprised of sound localization, sound clarity, speech, 
      and physical fatigue. Social included relationships, isolation, communication, 
      independence, work function, social stigma, and confidence. Mental comprised of 
      depression, anxiety, listening effort, mental fatigue, fear, and identity. These 
      findings will inform the development of hearing-specific questionnaire items to 
      describe people’s health-related quality of life. It’s important to use 
      qualitative research to inform the development of patient-reported outcome 
      measures to ensure that areas that are most important to patients are included 
      using wording that is understandable by the target participants.

TI  - Effect of yoga in quality of life among patients with oral cancer: a systematic 
      review.
PG  - 106-111
AB  - Head and neck cancer, which includes the oral cancer, is the seventh commonest 
      cancer worldwide, estimating for more than 660,000 fresh cases and 325,000 
      mortalities every year. However, cancer and its treatment are often associated 
      with prolonged adverse physical and psychosocial symptoms, including reduced 
      physical function and fitness and increased risk of anxiety, depression, and 
      fatigue. This greatly impacts the patient's quality of life (QoL). The aim of the 
      present study is to conduct a systematic review of the effects of yoga in in 
      quality of life among patients with oral cancer. An electronic database search 
      was performed to identify the suitable literature using Cochrane, EBSCO host, 
      PubMed and Trip database. The literary search was focused on the effect of yoga 
      on quality of life among oral cancer patients. A total of 23 relevant studies 
      were identified, and only 2 articles were taken for the systematic review. The 
      review concludes that yoga improves the quality of life among oral cancer 
      patients.

AB  - Quality of Life (QoL) is a crucial concept that pertains to an individual's 
      perception of their position in life. In the context of developmental 
      disabilities, QoL is pivotal for improving evidence-based practices, providing 
      support and organizing services for individuals, thereby enabling them to achieve 
      their potential with dignity and equality. Despite its importance, QoL has often 
      not been the primary focus in many studies on developmental disabilities and 
      remains less developed compared to other research areas. This study aims to 
      provide a comprehensive understanding of the existing knowledge in this thematic 
      area. A document co-citation analysis was conducted to identify the most 
      impactful publications and main thematic domains of research in the literature 
      (N = 2141 documents and their 97,547 citations). A total of 21 impactful 
      documents were identified, most of which focused on issues related to the 
      conceptualization and assessment of QoL. Nine major thematic domains of research 
      were outlined. In line with the impactful publications, some research themes 
      focused on conceptual issues (e.g., self-reported QoL and QoL reported from 
      others) and assessment approaches. Furthermore, the literature has transitioned 
      towards broadening the QoL perspective in the context of family and social 
      systems. The study provides an overview of how QoL has been studied in the 
      context of developmental disabilities, highlighting the interdependence of 
      individuals, families, and communities in ensuring a fulfilling life through the 
      lens of QoL.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and critically appraise prognostic models for 
      quality of life (QOL) in patients with total knee replacement (TKA). METHODS: 
      Subjects were TKA recipients recruited from inpatient postoperative settings. 
      Searches were made on June 2022 and updated on April 2023. Databases included 
      PubMed.gov, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science. Two authors performed 
      all review stages independently. Risk of bias assessments on participants, 
      predictors, outcomes and analysis methods followed the Prediction study Risk Of 
      Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST). RESULTS: After screening 2204 studies, 9 were 
      eligible for inclusion. Twelve prognostic models were reported, of which 10 
      models were developed from data without validation and 2 were both developed and 
      validated. The most frequently applied predictor was the pre-TKA QOL score. 
      Discriminatory measures were reported for 9 (75.0%) models with areas under the 
      curve values of 0.66-0.95. All models showed a high risk of bias, mostly due to 
      limitations in statistical methods and outcome assessments. CONCLUSION: Several 
      prognostic models have been developed for QOL in patients with TKA, but all 
      models show a high risk of bias and are unreliable in clinical practice. Future, 
      prognostic models overcoming the risk of bias identified in this study are 
      needed.

TI  - Neuropsychological performances, quality of life, and psychological issues in 
      pediatric onset multiple sclerosis: a narrative review.
PG  - 1913-1930
LID - 10.1007/s10072-023-07281-y [doi]
AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is primarily a disease diagnosed in young and middle-aged 
      adults. Although MS is a rare condition in pediatric age, an increasing rate of 
      patients is diagnosed under the age of 18. The disabling nature of the disease 
      cannot be reduced only to physical symptoms. Several additional symptoms such as 
      cognitive impairment, fatigue, and psychological symptoms are common features of 
      pediatric MS. The reviewed literature suggests that, despite the lower physical 
      disability, children and adolescents diagnosed with MS are vulnerable to 
      cognitive impairment even in the early stage of the disease. The 
      neuropsychological profile of pediatric MS may resemble that of adult MS, 
      including an impairment in attention/information processing speed, learning, 
      verbal, and visuospatial memory. However, cognitive difficulties in children and 
      adolescents are more likely to involve also general intelligence and linguistic 
      abilities, presumably due to patients' younger age and cognitive growth stage. 
      Cognitive difficulties, beyond physical disability and relapses, may have a 
      considerable impact on learning and school achievement. Depression and fatigue 
      are other highly prevalent disturbances in pediatric MS and may contribute to 
      patients' low functional outcomes. Overall, these manifestations may cause 
      considerable functional impairment on daily activities and quality of life that 
      may require individualized rehabilitative treatment and extensive psychosocial 
      care. Additional neuropsychological research evaluating larger samples, using 
      more homogenous methods, and exploring the role of MS treatment on cognitive and 
      psychological development is required.

AB  - Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) usually affects the maxillary and mandibular branches 
      of the fifth cranial nerve. Although the condition is primarily unilateral, few 
      cases of bilateral manifestation have been reported. TN is uncommon; however, it 
      significantly affects patients' quality of life because the neuropathic pain 
      worsens over time. Paroxysmal pain is triggered by mechanical stimuli or 
      environmental factors. Diagnosis is usually based on clinical findings, including 
      pain triggered by palpation of distinct areas; nevertheless, imaging studies, 
      such as magnetic resonance imaging, are always used to rule out a secondary 
      cause. TN can be caused by several factors, such as trauma and neurovascular 
      compression, or could be idiopathic, which complicates its treatment. Although 
      several studies focused on TN have been reported, a treatment modality with 100% 
      efficacy is lacking. The first-line treatment is pharmacological; however, 
      surgery may be required if symptoms persist.

AB  - This review examines factors associated with quality of life (QoL) in persons 
      with young-onset dementia (YOD). Studies investigating and analysing factors 
      related to QoL in persons with YOD were included. Databases searched included 
      PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, EMBASE, and SCOPUS. Due to inconsistent outcome 
      variables across studies, synthesis without meta-analysis was used for data 
      integration. Methodological quality was assessed, and results were synthesised. 
      Eleven studies were included in this review, identifying different factors 
      influencing QoL in persons with YOD, which could be categorised into six groups. 
      Behavioural and psychiatric factors showed the highest significant findings ratio 
      (SFR), as determined by the ratio of 'studies finding significance' to the 'total 
      number of studies addressing the factor'. Following in terms of SFR were 
      care-related and physical factors. Demographic and dementia-characteristic 
      factors had the lowest SFR. Among single factors, depressive symptoms, and 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms, both included in behavioural and psychiatric factors, 
      had the highest SFR. This systematic review highlights the importance of 
      behavioural and psychiatric elements in QoL in persons with young onset and 
      points to depressive symptoms and neuropsychiatric symptoms as potential 
      therapeutic targets. However, as research on QoL in persons with YOD continues to 
      expand, the inclusion of methods such as meta-analysis may be beneficial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects a significant proportion 
      of pregnant women, impacting both physical and psychological well-being. This 
      study aimed to investigate the factors influencing quality of life (QoL) in women 
      with GDM. METHODS: This systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines and was 
      registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42024612587). A comprehensive search was conducted 
      in PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Web of Science, and CINAHL, using MeSH terms related 
      to gestational diabetes and quality of life. Eligible studies included adult 
      women with gestational diabetes and assessed factors influencing their quality of 
      life. The included studies were related to various stages including antenatal, 
      during pregnancy or postpartum. Data extraction was performed independently by 
      two authors, and study quality was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale 
      (NOS). Statistical analyses were conducted in STATA, including meta-analysis with 
      a random-effects model. FINDINGS: The findings reveal that women with GDM 
      experience significantly lower QoL compared to healthy pregnant women, with 
      sexual dysfunction being a notable contributor. Women with GDM reported lower 
      sexual desire, satisfaction, and higher pain levels, which were significantly 
      associated with poorer QoL, particularly in mental health and pain domains. 
      Socio-demographic factors such as age, education, income, and marital status were 
      significantly linked to QoL, with younger women and those with lower education or 
      income reporting poorer outcomes. Psychological factors, including stress, 
      depression, and anxiety, negatively impacted QoL, while social support, 
      self-efficacy, and illness acceptance were positively correlated with better QoL 
      outcomes. Additionally, stress was found to be the main predictor of QoL for 
      women over 30, while social relationships were more important for younger women. 
      Treatment with insulin or a combination of insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents 
      was associated with lower QoL compared to dietary management alone. CONCLUSION: 
      This systematic review identified key psychosocial and medical factors 
      influencing the quality of life in women with gestational diabetes. The findings 
      emphasize the importance of addressing psychological well-being, social support, 
      and treatment approaches to enhance QoL in these women. Further research is 
      needed to explore interventions targeting mental health and stress management to 
      improve outcomes for women with gestational diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Research on rare diseases focuses less on caregivers, who play an 
      important role in meeting the medical and social needs of the people they care 
      for. Caregivers of people with rare diseases face negative outcomes due to 
      problems with diagnosis, caring for complex conditions and expensive treatments. 
      However, the factors that affect their quality of life are poorly understood. 
      Poor mental and physical health of caregivers has a direct impact on the person 
      they are caring for. METHODS: To explore the literature on this topic, we 
      conducted a scoping review in which we identified and analysed relevant studies 
      to find out how extensively this topic has been researched. The articles were 
      retrieved from the bibliographic databases PubMed, Ovid Medline and Ebsco Cinahl. 
      RESULTS: We initially identified 299 references and then included thirty-four 
      articles. The included articles address three main topics, namely caregiver 
      quality of life, health care accessibility, and the impact of health care 
      accessibility on caregiver QOL. CONCLUSION: This study provides information that 
      is important to multiple providers of services as it can help to better 
      understand caregivers and people with rare diseases and improve the quality of 
      services offered. It highlights areas with the greatest need for change and 
      offers insight into the complexity of caring for people with rare diseases, 
      assisting policymakers in developing policies to support informal caregivers.

TI  - The effect of Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) on seizure control, cognitive 
      function, and quality of life in individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy: A 
      systematic review article.
PG  - 2101-2111
LID - 10.1002/epi4.13066 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) on seizure 
      control, cognitive functions, and quality of life in individuals with 
      drug-resistant epilepsy. METHODS: An extensive search of electronic databases was 
      carried out in order to carry out this systematic review. The databases Google 
      Scholar, Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library were searched first to carryout 
      gray literature. To reduce the quantity of pointless studies in the advanced 
      search, the search is limited to "human studies" and "English language" 
      publications only. Combining keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms 
      like ("Vagus Nerve Stimulation" OR "VNS") AND ("Epilepsy" OR "Seizure Control") 
      AND ("Cognitive Function" OR "Quality of Life"). Studies that have been published 
      up to November 30/2023 were included. RESULTS: The search strategy yielded a 
      total of 392 relevant studies. The mean age of participant's ranges from 11 years 
      to 33 years. The duration of follow-up ranging from 6 to 36 months. Eleven 
      studies were included in the review. The mean≥50% response rate after VNS therapy 
      was 56.94% ranged from 48.90% to 83.00%. Four and three studies provided 
      information about Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-31) and The 
      Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale (LSSS) questionnaires respectively. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: Epilepsy is a chronic disease characterized by sudden abnormal 
      discharge of brain neurons, which leads to transient brain dysfunction and the 
      presence of spontaneous recurrent seizures. Vagus nerve stimulation has recently 
      been proposed as a potential tool in the treatment of seizure, depressive 
      symptoms, and cognitive impairments. There has been variation in the effects of 
      VNS treatment on seizure control, cognitive functions, and quality of life among 
      patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. So, a comprehensive review of exciting 
      literature is important to see the pooled effect. Previous systematic review and 
      meta-analysis papers were mostly randomized control trial type with specific 
      diseases. The use of a wider variety of study designs than only randomized 
      controlled trials is important. So, we included retrospective and prospective 
      cohort studies in addition to randomized control trials. This enables a more 
      thorough assessment of the connection between quality of life, cognitive 
      function, and vagus nerve stimulation. In addition, the paper looks at a wide 
      range of disease kinds and patterns. We have established a uniform and 
      comprehensive approach throughout the selected studies by mandating the inclusion 
      of all three crucial parameters: vagus nerve stimulation, cognitive function, and 
      quality of life. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: This systematic review examined 392 
      relevant studies on vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy, with participants 
      ranging from 11 to 33 years old and follow-up durations of 6-36 months. Eleven 
      studies were included, and the mean response rate after VNS therapy was 56.94%, 
      ranging from 48.90% to 83.00%. The review also reported on quality of life and 
      cognitive function, and seizure severity frequency result from several studies.

AB  - PURPOSE: We conducted a systematic review to describe health-related quality of 
      life (HRQOL) in rural cancer survivors (RCS), and compare HRQOL between RCS and 
      urban cancer survivors (UCS). METHOD: We searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL Plus, 
      and PsycINFO for studies with HRQOL in adult cancer survivors living in rural, 
      regional, remote, and urban areas, who had completed definitive primary cancer 
      treatment, without evidence of residual disease. Where available, we used 
      normative and clinically important values to ascribe meaning to HRQOL data. 
      FINDINGS: Fifteen studies (16 papers) were included. Most were from the US 
      (n = 8) and reported on breast cancer survivors (n = 9). Six HRQOL instruments, 
      collecting data across 16 domains, were used. Three instruments were specific to 
      the survivorship phase. Normative and clinical data were available for 12 
      studies. Compared with normative populations, RCS had clinically worse physical 
      HRQOL (6/12 studies), better social/family (5/7), and functional (3/6) HRQOL, and 
      there were no differences in emotional or/mental HRQOL (9/12). In six studies 
      with rural-urban comparator groups and normative and clinically important data, 
      RCS and UCS had clinically worse physical (3/6 and 2/6, respectively) and better 
      social/family (3/4 and 2/4 studies, respectively) HRQOL than normative 
      populations. Functional HRQOL was better in RCS (2/4 studies) than UCS and 
      normative populations. In 3/6 studies, there were no clinical differences in 
      emotional or/mental HRQOL between RCS, UCS, and normative populations. 
      CONCLUSION: Overall, HRQOL is not clearly better or worse in RCS than UCS. Future 
      research should include different tumor types, rural residents, and 
      survivorship-specific HRQOL instruments.

TI  - Health-related quality of life in pediatric patients with intestinal failure 
      without neurodevelopmental delay: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 80

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intestinal failure (IF) is a broad term encompassing various 
      conditions that hinder the body's ability to absorb nutrients for growth and 
      maintenance. These conditions can significantly affect child's well-being, 
      leading to physical limitations, psychological distress, and social isolation. We 
      aimed to evaluate the available data on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in 
      pediatric patients with IF and without neurodevelopmental delay. METHODS: For 
      this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, 
      PubMed, and Web of Science. All observational studies of pediatric patients (< 18 
      years) with IF which measured HRQOL and with evidence of absence of 
      neurodevelopmental delay were included, without language or date restrictions, up 
      to June 2024. We did separate random-effects meta-analyses for overall HRQOL and 
      subgroup domains. Evidence from observational studies was synthesised as 
      differences between standardised mean differences (SMDs) for all subgroup 
      domains. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistic and the Cochran Q 
      test. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. 
      This study is registered on PROSPERO, number CRD42024561812. RESULTS: Of 491 
      records identified, 14 were eligible and data were available for 12 studies, all 
      of which had a fair/good quality. The included studies involved a pooled sample 
      of 510 participants (mean age = 7.0 ± 3.6 years). The analysis disclosed that 
      compared to healthy children, pediatric patients with IF had lower overall 
      quality of life in both child- and parent-report (Standardized Mean Difference 
      [SMD]= -0.62; 95% CI [-0.80, -0.43]; p < 0.001, and SMD= -0.70; 95% CI [-1.11, 
      -0.28]; p < 0.001, respectively), except for emotional and social domains 
      (SMD[child] = -0.23; 95% CI [ -0.38, -0.08]; p = 0.001 Vs SMD[parent]= -0.23; 95% 
      CI [ -0.60, 0.14]; p = 0.21, and SMD[child] = -0.40; 95% CI [ -0.70, -0.10]; 
      p = 0.007 Vs SMD[parent]= -0.24; 95% CI [ -0.62, 0.14]; p = 0.21, respectively), 
      where parents overestimate emotional and social HRQOL of their children. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the significant impact of IF on well-being of 
      pediatric patients. Targeted interventions addressing both physical and 
      psychosocial needs are crucial to improve HRQOL in this population.

TI  - Health-related quality of life and health state utility value in idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 3
LID - 10.1186/s12955-024-02326-y [doi]
LID - 3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is associated with high 
      mortality, heavy economic burden, limited treatment options and poor prognosis, 
      and seriously affects the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and life 
      expectancy of patients. This systematic review and meta-analysis of HRQoL and 
      health state utility value (HSUV) in IPF patients and the instruments used in 
      this assessment aimed to provide information sources and data support for the 
      future research on IPF HRQoL and HSUV. METHODS: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, 
      Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases for studies reporting the HRQoL or 
      HSUV of IPF patients, with the retrieval time from the establishment of each 
      database to April 2024. After two researchers independently screened the 
      literature, extracted the data, and evaluated the risk of bias in the included 
      studies, pooled analysis was performed on the measurement tools adopted in more 
      than two studies. Subgroup analysis was employed to explore the source of 
      heterogeneity, and sensitivity analysis was used to assess the robustness of the 
      results. Funnel-plot directed evaluation combined with Egger's test quantitative 
      evaluation was conducted to detect publication bias. RESULTS: Sixty-nine studies 
      were ultimately included, covering eighteen measurement tools. The literature 
      quality was generally excellent. The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire 
      (SGRQ), EuroQoL Five Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D), Short Form-36 (SF-36) and 
      the King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease (KBILD) were the most common 
      instruments, among which the EQ-5D included the HSUV and the visual analog scale 
      (VAS). The results of the meta-analysis revealed that the pooled SGRQ total score 
      was 45.28 (95% confidence interval [CI] 41.10-49.47), the mean EQ-5D utility 
      score was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.72-0.79), the total EQ-5D VAS score was 66.88 (95% CI: 
      63.75-70.01), and the pooled SF-36 physical component summary (PCS) and mental 
      component summary (MCS) score were 36.70 (95% CI: 32.98-40.41) and 48.99 (95% CI: 
      47.44-50.55), respectively. The total KBILD score was 58.31 (95% CI: 
      55.43-61.19), the IPF specific version of the SGRQ (SGRQ-I) was 40.38 (95% CI: 
      28.81-51.96) and the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) score was 16.09 (95% CI: 
      15.45-16.74). The pooled result of the University of California San Diego 
      Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (USCD-SOBQ) was 45.05 (95% CI: 41.56-48.55). 
      The results of other instruments, such as the tool to assess quality of life in 
      IPF (ATAQ-IPF), the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment 100 
      (WHOQoL-100) and the 12-item short-form health survey (SF-12) were similar to 
      those of the above measurement tools. Regretfully, subgroup analyses did not 
      identify the source of heterogeneity, but sensitivity analyses demonstrated 
      robustness of our results. Except for the SGRQ total, our results showed little 
      possibility of publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL in IPF patients is generally 
      poor, and all domains are severely affected. With the aggravation of disease, 
      HRQoL and HSUV shows a relatively downward trend, and income level is also an 
      important factor affecting HRQoL and HSUV. At present, the published studies on 
      IPF HRQoL and HSUV have applied many measurement tools with high interstudy 
      heterogeneity, and future research on the optimal disease measurement tools 
      should be strengthened. Our study provides high-quality comprehensive evidence 
      for IPF HRQoL and HSUV, which can be used to guide clinical and economic 
      evaluation in the future.

AB  - Intermittent fasting is a dietary intervention that is increasingly being tested 
      for positive outcomes in patients receiving cancer treatment. In this review, we 
      examine the impact of intermittent fasting on symptoms, toxicities, and quality 
      of life in patients undergoing cancer therapy and highlight unmet investigative 
      areas to prompt future research. While current evidence is preliminary and 
      conclusions mixed, some promising clinical studies suggest that intermittent 
      fasting interventions may improve fatigue and reduce gastrointestinal toxicities 
      in certain patients with cancer. Emerging clinical evidence also demonstrates 
      that intermittent fasting may reduce off-target DNA damage, and induce favorable 
      cellular-level immune remodeling. Furthermore, intermittent fasting has the 
      potential to lower hyperglycemia and the ratio of fat to lean body mass, which 
      may benefit patients at risk of hyperglycemia and weight-related adverse effects 
      of some common pharmacological cancer treatments. Larger controlled studies are 
      necessary to evaluate intermittent fasting in relation to these endpoints and 
      determine the effectiveness of intermittent fasting as an adjunct intervention 
      during cancer care. Future cancer trials should evaluate intermittent fasting 
      diets in the context of multimodal diet, exercise, and nutrition strategies, and 
      also evaluate the impact of intermittent fasting on other important areas such as 
      the circadian system and the gut microbiome.

TI  - Factors influencing food-related quality of life in patients with inflammatory 
      bowel disease: A systematic review.
PG  - e14133
LID - 10.1111/jep.14133 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: People diagnosed with Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often have 
      severe dietary restrictions and avoidance due to the uncertainty of intestinal 
      symptoms. Inadequate dietary intake may increase the risk of malnutrition and 
      result in impaired food-related quality of life (FRQoL). Few studies investigated 
      factors influencing FRQoL in patients with IBD. This study aimed to synthesize 
      the existing evidence regarding FRQoL among patients with IBD, including the 
      current situation, measurement instruments, and related influencing factors. 
      METHOD: The comprehensive literature search was conducted in databases including 
      PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, as well as the most commonly 
      used Chinese databases (CNKI, Wanfang and CBM). Studies published between January 
      2015 and December 2023 on FRQoL in patients with IBD were included. The Joanna 
      Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist was utilized to evaluate the 
      methodological quality of the selected studies. RESULTS: Finally, only five 
      studies met the inclusion criteria were reviewed, including three cross-sectional 
      studies and two case-control studies. The Food-related quality of life-29 Scale 
      (FR-QoL-29) with a total core of 145 was the most used instrument measuring FRQoL 
      in patients with IBD. The mean scores of FRQoL ranged from 69.9 to 102.3 in adult 
      patients with IBD and 94.3 in children. A diverse range of factors were 
      associated with FRQoL, including socio-demographic, clinical, psychological, 
      diet-related, and nutrient intake factors. CONCLUSIONS: The main influencing 
      factors of FRQoL among patients with IBD included disease activity status, severe 
      symptoms, history of IBD surgery, negative emotion reaction, and restrictive 
      eating behaviour. Clinicians should work in concert with dietitians, keeping an 
      eye on the disease status, nutrition intake, and restrictive eating habits, 
      assessing FRQoL and providing personalized dietary recommendation for the 
      patients with IBD.

TI  - Association of spirituality and quality of life in cancer survivors: a systematic 
      review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 246
LID - 10.1007/s00520-025-09306-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although 
      people are living longer with cancer, cancer has the potential to impact 
      survivors' quality of life (QOL) negatively. Spirituality encompasses the 
      concepts of transcendence, meaningfulness, faith, connectedness, and integrative 
      energy. Spirituality is a part of everyday existence across cultures and 
      religions and part of the human experience. Yet little has been published on 
      spirituality in cancer survivorship. We could not find any previous reviews that 
      examined the literature on the potential relationship between QOL and 
      spirituality in cancer survivorship. Thus, this systematic review and 
      meta-analysis aim to examine the current literature to more fully understand the 
      relationship between spirituality and QOL. METHODS: Using PRISMA guidelines, a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to examine the relationship 
      between spirituality and QOL in cancer survivorship in studies sourced from 
      PubMed, CINHAL, and PsycINFO databases. RESULTS: Twenty-six articles published 
      between 2005 and 2024 were included for review. All studies demonstrated a 
      significant, positive correlation between QOL and spirituality, with r values 
      ranging from 0.15 to 0.817. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a positive 
      correlation between higher spirituality and increased QOL among cancer survivors. 
      Future research is needed to improve the understanding of this relationship and 
      its mediators so that supportive oncologic interventions can be modified to 
      address unmet needs and spiritual suffering. By better understanding the 
      relationship between spirituality and QOL, we can move towards supporting the 
      highest level of QOL possible for cancer survivors.

TI  - Which factors may influence medium-term quality of life of patients with 
      lower-limb loss? A systematic review of the literature.
PG  - 14-29
LID - 10.1097/PXR.0000000000000312 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature to 
      identify factors that may influence quality of life in people with lower-limb 
      amputation (all etiologies). Our primary focus was on identifying factors that 
      can be modified, enabling a more concentrated integration of these aspects into 
      the care and treatment of amputated patients. DATA SOURCE: Medline (via Ovid) and 
      Scopus were searched in January 2023 for studies assessing quality of life for 
      people with lower-limb loss. Studies were included if they reported on factors 
      that could influence quality of life. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
      Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were 
      identified and assessed independently by 2 reviewers. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were 
      extracted by 2 independent reviewers. DATA SYNTHESIS: After removing duplicates, 
      the search yielded 2616 studies, of which 24 met our inclusion criteria 
      (cross-sectional n = 13; prospective n = 9; retrospective n = 2). The most 
      commonly used quality-of-life instruments were the Short Form 36, followed by the 
      World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF and the EuroQoL 5 dimension. 
      Younger age, traumatic etiology, unilateral or below-knee amputation, presence of 
      comorbidities, and social integration were found to influence quality of life in 
      people with lower-limb amputation, whereas sex and socioeconomic context do not 
      seem to have a clear influence. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review of the 
      literature identified several factors that influence quality of life in patients 
      with lower-limb amputation. However, the results are not always consistent across 
      studies and there is still no consensus on some factors. Conclusive findings 
      regarding sex and socioeconomic status remain elusive, primarily because of 
      substantial disparities observed across the literature. Future prospective 
      longitudinal studies with clear a priori inclusion of a wide range of potential 
      factors are needed to clarify the impact of the identified factors. Factors such 
      as age, type of amputation, comorbidities and social integration should be 
      considered in the management of patients with amputation.

AB  - Persons with heart failure (HF) often suffer from poor symptom control, decreased 
      quality of life, and poor communication with their health care providers. These 
      needs are particularly acute in advanced HF, a leading cause of death in the 
      United States. Palliative care, when offered alongside HF disease management, 
      offers improved symptom control, quality of life, communication, and caregiver 
      satisfaction as well as reduced caregiver anxiety. The dynamic nature of the 
      clinical trajectory of HF presents distinct symptom patterns, changing functional 
      status, and uncertainty, which requires an adaptive, dynamic model of palliative 
      care delivery. Due to a limited specialty-trained palliative care workforce, 
      patients and their caregivers often cannot access these benefits, especially in 
      the community. To meet these needs, new models are required that are better 
      informed by high-quality data, engage a range of health care providers in primary 
      palliative care principles, and have clear triggers for specialty palliative care 
      engagement, with specific palliative interventions tailored to patient's illness 
      trajectory and changing needs.

      patients with oral cancer. METHODS: CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, CBM, Pubmed, Medline, Web 
      of Science, Embase, and The Cochrane Library were searched up to May 2023 for 
      studies that evaluated the quality of life of patients with oral cancer. All the 
      included studies were independently selected, extracted, and rated by two 
      researchers, and results are summarized by qualitative analysis. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-four articles on 2 717 patients were included. Factors related to the 
      quality of life of patients with oral cancer mainly included age, tumor TNM 
      stage, radiochemotherapy, and gender, which could be summarized into three 
      aspects: personal factors, disease-related factors, and surgical factors. More 
      than five studies reported on the analysis of age, gender, tumor TNM stage, 
      pathological stage, neck dissection method, marital status, recurrence, smoking, 
      education level, etc. The results are relatively consistent. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      incidence of oral cancer increases, and many factors affected the quality of 
      life. The included literature is a cross-sectional study, and the sample size is 
      limited. The causal relationship between relevant factors and quality of life 
      should be verified using large sample sizes.

TI  - Mapping and comparing the quality of life outcomes in childhood and adolescent 
      and young adult cancer survivors: an umbrella review and future directions.
PG  - 633-656
LID - 10.1007/s11136-024-03825-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A cancer diagnosis early in life can leave a legacy in terms of 
      compromised Quality of Life (QoL). There is a lack of clarity regarding the 
      impact on QoL according to age at diagnosis, with childhood cancer survivors 
      (CCS) and adolescents and young adult cancer survivors (AYACS) often combined. As 
      part of an EORTC Quality of Life Group study, this umbrella review aims to (1) 
      identify the QoL outcomes reported in the literature for both CCS and AYACS, and 
      (2) investigate the similarities and differences in QoL challenges between both 
      groups. METHODS: A systematic literature search of systematic reviews and 
      meta-analyses was conducted in December 2023 using PubMed, PsychInfo, and CINAHL. 
      Methodological quality was evaluated using the AMSTAR tool. RESULTS: Overall, 
      1457 articles were assessed, and 39 systematic reviews and meta-analyses met the 
      inclusion criteria. QoL outcomes were categorized into eight QoL domains, all of 
      which were reported in both groups of young survivors. However, reviews on CCS 
      often focused on outcomes relating to emotional functioning, cognitive 
      difficulties, social challenges, school functioning, body image and overall 
      happiness, whereas AYACS reviews had a greater focus on depressive symptoms, 
      outcomes related to sexual health and reproductive health, employment, financial 
      difficulties, self-image and identity and the impact of cancer. CONCLUSION: This 
      umbrella review comprehensively explores QoL outcomes among CCS and AYACS, 
      revealing both shared and distinct challenges. Future research should focus on 
      developing tailored questionnaires, emphasizing transition periods and 
      incorporating a life perspective to capture unique developmental tasks of young 
      survivors.

AB  - Pulmonary hypertension is a disease that impairs cardiopulmonary function and is 
      characterised by the limitation of progressive physical activity and decline in 
      health-related quality of life. Patients usually present with a range of severe 
      symptoms, including dyspnoea, fatigue, chest pain and oedema, which affect their 
      quality of life. Compared to the general population, patients usually have a 
      lower health-related quality of life, with differences in several aspects such as 
      physical functioning, mental health, social interactions and career. The aim of 
      this review is to examine recent research advances in health-related quality of 
      life in patients with pulmonary hypertension, including its influencing factors 
      and improvement measures, in order to improve the understanding and management of 
      this condition.

TI  - Effect of nonpharmacological interventions on nutrition status, complications and 
      quality of life in head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy: A 
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - e13277
LID - 10.1111/ijn.13277 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of nonpharmacological therapies on nutrition 
      status, complications and quality of life in head and neck cancer patients and to 
      provide a basis for clinical practice. METHODS: This systematic review was 
      reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review 
      and Meta-analysis statement. Ten databases were systematically searched for all 
      available articles from construction to November 2023. Two researchers 
      independently conducted literature screening, data extraction and quality 
      evaluation. Cochrane Review Manager 5.3 was used for meta-analysis. RESULTS: 
      Finally, 27 RCT studies including 2814 patients with head and neck cancer were 
      included. Five categories of interventions were used: nutritional support, 
      exercise, swallowing function training, psychological intervention and low-level 
      laser therapy. Nonpharmacological interventions can improve body weight loss in 
      patients with HNC at the end of treatment (MD: 1.66 kg; 95% CI: 0.80 to 2.51), 
      and subgroup analysis showed that nutritional support, psychological intervention 
      and low-level laser therapy were effective. Nonpharmacological interventions can 
      also ameliorate decreases in BMI (MD: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.16 to 1.26) and reduce the 
      incidence of malnutrition (RR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.86), oral mucositis (RR: 
      0.54; 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.80) and gastrointestinal complications (RR: 0.61; 95% CI: 
      0.38 to 0.96) during radiotherapy; however, no significant differences were found 
      in other complications and quality of life. CONCLUSION: Nonpharmacological 
      interventions can improve the nutrition status of patients with head and neck 
      cancer and reduce the incidence of severe oral mucositis and gastrointestinal 
      complications during radiotherapy but have no significant impact on quality of 
      life.

TI  - Factors Influencing the Quality of Life (QOL) of Advanced Cancer Patients in 
      Home-based Palliative Care (HBPC): A Systematic Review.
PG  - 3789-3797
LID - 91407 [pii]
LID - 10.31557/APJCP.2024.25.11.3789 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Despite the widespread recognition of the need for new palliative care 
      models to better serve advanced cancer patients at the end of life, little 
      importance is given to assessing the effectiveness of homecare models. OBJECTIVE: 
      This systematic review aims to summarize factors influencing the quality of life 
      (QOL) of advanced cancer patients in home-based palliative care (HBPC) being 
      adopted worldwide. METHODS: Following the PRISMA guidelines, electronic databases 
      such as MEDLINE, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Scopus databases from 2000 to February 
      2024 were systematically searched using predetermined search terms of "quality of 
      life", "home-based palliative care" as well as "advanced cancer". Studies with 
      less than ten subjects, scoping reviews, conference abstracts, and that adopted 
      poorly validated QOL questionnaires were excluded. RESULTS: Twenty-two (22) 
      studies from both developed and developing countries were included in the 
      narrative synthesis. 45.4% were cross-sectional, 27.2% were prospective cohort 
      studies, 13.6% were retrospective cohort studies, and 18.1% were RCTs or 
      quasi-experimental studies. Around 33 QOL factors were studied with 16 different 
      types of QOL instruments. Advanced cancer patients who practiced spirituality, 
      female gender, were married, had satisfaction with care, and preferred home as a 
      place of death showed higher QOL scores. Older patients, aware of cancer 
      diagnosis, poor performance status, high pain score, symptom distress, and 
      psychological distress were associated with a poor QOL. CONCLUSION: Various 
      factors affect QOL among cancer patients in HBPC. Hence it shows the importance 
      of interventions to improve QOL and their rigorous implementation. With the 
      widespread adoption of multi-disciplinary home care palliative programs, 
      palliative care services to advanced cancer patients can be delivered readily 
      which may be cost-effective.

TI  - The changes in health-related quality of life after attending cardiac 
      rehabilitation: A qualitative systematic review of the perspective of patients 
      living with heart disease.
PG  - e0313612
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0313612 [doi]
LID - e0313612
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the benefits of engaging in cardiac rehabilitation are well 
      established, patient perceptions of the changes in their health-related quality 
      of life are poorly documented. This systematic review synthesized qualitative 
      studies on patients' perspectives of change in their health-related quality of 
      life after attending cardiac rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: To identify and 
      synthesize the best available evidence on the perspective of patients living with 
      heart disease about the changes in their health-related quality of life after 
      attending cardiac rehabilitation. METHODS: Eight databases were used to identify 
      relevant papers published in English and peer-reviewed, and no date restrictions 
      were considered for the search. This systematic review followed the Preferred 
      Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The 
      Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist was used to appraise 
      the quality of each paper, and two independent reviewers conducted it. A 
      meta-aggregation approach was used to synthesize the findings of the included 
      studies. RESULTS: The search identified 10813 titles. Thirty-five full-text 
      papers were reviewed after duplicates were removed, and the titles and abstracts 
      were reviewed. Thirteen papers were retained for data synthesis. The synthesized 
      findings were divided into three categories: building healthier habits, peer 
      interaction, and improving mental health. CONCLUSION: This review demonstrates 
      the positive changes in health-related quality of life for those patients engaged 
      in cardiac rehabilitation. Peer interaction with other patients improved both 
      mental and physical health. This review indicated that adopting healthier habits, 
      including healthy eating and regular physical activity, had substantial benefits 
      in formulating healthy behavior. The role of peers in supporting the development 
      of a healthy lifestyle appears to be an understudied avenue and has potential for 
      development.

TI  - The Effect of Religious-Spiritual Education and Care on the Quality of Life of 
      Iranian Women: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 2291-2313
LID - 10.1007/s10943-024-02002-x [doi]
AB  - So far, several preliminary studies have been conducted on the effect of 
      religious-spiritual education and care on the quality of life of women in 
      different parts of Iran. Therefore, the current study aims to explore the effect 
      of religious-spiritual education and care on the quality of life of Iranian women 
      through systematic review and meta-analysis. Databases searched for studies 
      related to the research objective include SID, MagIran, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, 
      WoS, and Google Scholar. The search was performed using keywords linked to and 
      validated with MeSH/Emtree with no time limit until April 2022. The I(2) index 
      was used to calculate the heterogeneity of the studies and the random effects 
      model was used to combine the data and perform the meta-analysis. Finally, 14 
      articles with a sample size of 295 intervention group and 288 control group were 
      included in the meta-analysis. The mean score of the quality of life after the 
      intervention showed a significant increase of 1.87 ± 0.29 (95% confidence 
      interval) per unit (P < 0.001). Meta-regression results showed that with the 
      increasing year of study and age, the standardized mean difference decreased and 
      with increasing the number of intervention sessions, this difference increased 
      (P < 0.05). The results of this study show that religious-spiritual education and 
      care significantly increase the quality of life of Iranian women. Therefore, it 
      seems that the use of religious-spiritual education and care can be part of the 
      program to increase the quality of life of women.

TI  - Oral health-related quality of life in the East African community: a scoping

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Limited access to oral healthcare and substantial untreated cases 
      raises concerns about the rising burden of oral conditions in East Africa. This 
      scoping review aimed to map the existing evidence on oral health status in 
      relation to oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) across the East African 
      Community (EAC). METHODS: This scoping review was conducted based on the 
      recommendations of Arksey and O'Malley's guidelines and reported based on the 
      PRISMA-ScR checklist. Ten electronic databases were searched, using relevant 
      keywords informed by the PCC (Population-Concept-Context) framework. The 
      retrieved articles were deduplicated and screened for eligibility. Twenty-eight 
      eligible articles were finally included in this review. The data charted from the 
      included articles were collated, summarized, and reported thematically. RESULTS: 
      Oral health conditions were highly prevalent in East Africa, ranging from 15.8 to 
      83.0%, with dental caries being the most common. Prevalence and impact varied 
      across socio-demographic factors, including age, gender, education, and place of 
      residence. Clinical factors such as DMFT/dmft scores and pain levels, and 
      knowledge of preventive practices, also played a crucial role in influencing oral 
      health outcomes. While many reported satisfactions with their oral health, oral 
      conditions significantly impacted their quality of life, disrupting essential 
      activities like eating, sleeping, hygiene, relaxation, and social interaction. 
      Despite the widespread occurrence and associated discomfort, the majority failed 
      to seek dental care, resulting in persistent daily challenges and diminished 
      overall well-being. CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of oral conditions with serious 
      impacts on quality of life and wellbeing was observed in the EAC. Given the 
      satisfaction with oral health and the poor attitude towards seeking help for oral 
      issues despite experiencing pain, we recommend future research to explore, 
      identify, and implement contextually and culturally relevant interventions that 
      will be tailored to the specific oral health needs of East African populations.

TI  - Investigating various interventions to improve the quality of life of children 
      and adolescents suffering from chronic diseases - a systematic review.
PG  - 525-540
LID - 10.1515/ijamh-2024-0166 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The transition from childhood to adulthood is an ups-and-down 
      experience determined by increased independence, formation, and development of 
      personal identity. Children with chronic diseases compared to their peers, face 
      more challenges during this period that can exacerbate their symptoms and 
      negatively affect their quality of life. This research aims to review the studies 
      that have investigated the ways to improve the quality of life of children and 
      adolescents with chronic diseases in Iran. CONTENT: In this study, a search was 
      done in the international databases of PubMed, Scopus, web of Science, Google 
      Scholar, and the internal databases of Magiran and SID with related keywords 
      including children, adolescents, chronic diseases, quality of life, health, 
      nursing interventions were carried out from 2010 to July 2024. Exclusion criteria 
      included summaries of conference articles and foreign articles other than Persian 
      and English. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK: In the primary search, 363 articles were found. 
      After removing duplicates and unrelated items, and finally, 36 articles (52.77 % 
      in English, 47.22 % in Persian) were examined in line with the objectives of the 
      present study. The results of the study indicate that non-pharmacological 
      interventions can significantly improve the quality of life of adolescents with 
      chronic diseases. Nursing interventions appear to have a positive and significant 
      effect on the quality of life of children and adolescents with chronic illness.

TI  - Do Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions improve family quality of 
      life? A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 2152-2165
LID - 10.1177/13623613241227516 [doi]
AB  - Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions have been described as 
      culturally responsive and family-friendly interventions, with research 
      demonstrating improvements in children's development following the receipt of 
      these interventions. Given the child-directed nature of Naturalistic 
      Developmental Behavioral Interventions and the intervention's integration within 
      families' daily routines, many studies have examined the impact of Naturalistic 
      Developmental Behavioral Interventions on family and family member quality of 
      life. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the 
      relationship between Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions and 
      family quality of life. Results suggest that the provision of a Naturalistic 
      Developmental Behavioral Intervention neither improved nor worsened family or 
      family member quality of life. For those involved in delivering Naturalistic 
      Developmental Behavioral Intervention services, there is an immediate need to 
      convey to families that children's improvements will likely not translate into 
      improvements in family quality of life.

TI  - Impact of dental fluorosis on the oral health-related quality of life: a 
      systematic review.
PG  - 599
LID - 10.1007/s00784-024-05991-x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the literature to 
      assess the effect of dental fluorosis on the Oral Health-Related Quality of Life 
      (OHRQoL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Included studies were epidemiological 
      investigations, clinical trials, or human studies that directly compared the 
      impact on OHRQoL between individuals with dental fluorosis and those without, 
      utilizing valid OHRQoL assessment tools. The searches were conducted up to March 
      2024 in databases, including PubMed, Scielo, LILACS, Scopus, Web of Science, 
      Embase, and the Virtual Health Library. Additionally, gray literature sources 
      such as Google Scholar, OpenGrey, Ibict/BDTD, and ProQuest were searched. 
      Reference lists were also manually reviewed for potential eligible studies. The 
      risk of bias in cohort studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale 
      (NOS), while its modified version was employed for cross-sectional studies. A 
      narrative synthesis of the results was conducted. RESULTS: 16 studies were 
      included in this Systematic Review. In total, 16,314 participants, aged 8 to 18, 
      were assessed across the studies. Most of the included studies were 
      cross-sectional, except for one cohort study. In assessing OHRQoL across 
      different age groups and severities of dental fluorosis, the impact varied. A 
      negative association between dental fluorosis and OHRQoL was found in 9 of the 
      included studies, a positive association was found in 1 study, and no 
      significative association was identified in 6 studies. Limitations in the 
      included studies primarily pertained to cross-sectional designs, with significant 
      issues such as the absence of sample size calculations, lack of non-response rate 
      reporting, limited consideration of confounding factors, and substantial 
      heterogeneity stemming from diverse diagnostic methods and assessment tools. 
      CONCLUSION: The findings of the systematic review demonstrate a complex and 
      varied relationship between dental fluorosis and OHRQoL in children and 
      adolescents. These conclusions may have limitations in scientific evidence. The 
      findings emphasize the need for further investigations to explore the intricate 
      aspects of this relationship and identify contributing factors to varying 
      outcomes. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Dental caries preventive fluoridated measures might 
      be indicated even if there would be a risk for mild dental fluorosis as the 
      fluoridated public water. REVIEW REGISTRATION: This systematic review was 
      registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews 
      (PROSPERO) under number: CRD42020186552.

      review.
PG  - e13236
LID - 10.1111/wrr.13236 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this systematic review was to synthesise the evidence of the 
      impact of pressure injuries (PIs) on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
      of adults aged 18 years and older. Electronic databases (Ovid Medline, Ovid 
      Embase, CINAHL EBSCO, Scopus and Central Register of Controlled Trials) were 
      searched for eligible studies published between January 2019 and April 2024. All 
      identified articles were reviewed by two reviewers against the eligibility 
      criteria. The risk of bias was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool 
      and the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool. Data were narratively 
      synthesised due to methodological heterogeneity. Twenty-two studies (12 
      quantitative; 9 qualitative;1 mixed methods) met the inclusion criteria. The 
      qualitative studies were grouped into four impact areas: symptoms, physical 
      function, psychological well-being and social functioning. Five instruments were 
      used to assess HRQoL and identified low scores in people with PIs, with the 
      lowest scores mostly reported in physical functioning and role physical and 
      emotional concepts. A complexity of factors influenced theHRQoL of people with 
      PI. This review synthesised both quantitative and qualitative evidence indicating 
      PI was associated with low HRQoL scores and negatively affected all aspects of 
      HRQoL. This review emphasised the complexity of factors related to PI and its 
      impact on HRQoL. Further emphasis on the impact of the complexity of factors on 
      HRQoL of people with PI should be considered in future studies.

TI  - Effect of adaptive sports on quality of life in individuals with disabilities who 
      use wheelchairs: a mixed-methods systematic review.
PG  - 2774-2790
LID - 10.1080/17483107.2024.2313110 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Adaptive sports participation has been shown to improve quality of life 
      (QoL) in individual with disabilities. However, inconsistent results in various 
      domains of QoL exist in the literature. The objective of this mixed-methods 
      systematic review is to identify and synthesize evidence from quantitative and 
      qualitative studies on the effect of adaptive sports on QoL in individuals with 
      disabilities who use wheelchairs for mobility. METHODS: A systematic literature 
      review of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods research on the effect of 
      adaptive sports on QoL was conducted on five databases (Scopus, Web of Science, 
      PsycINFO, Medline, and PubMed). Quality appraisal was conducted by two authors by 
      using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. RESULTS: This review identified 4 key 
      findings from 41 studies, including 31 quantitative and 10 qualitative studies. 
      First, individuals with disabilities using wheelchairs for mobility who actively 
      engaged in adaptive sports tend to report higher QoL scores compared with those 
      who were inactive or did not participate. Second, the relationship between the 
      duration of regular participation in adaptive sports and QoL scores exhibited 
      inconsistent results. Third, a multi-component adaptive sports program 
      demonstrates the potential to further improve QoL scores. Last, qualitative 
      investigations reveal that participation in adaptive sports positively influences 
      various domains of well-being in wheelchair users, including encompassing 
      physical and emotional well-being, interpersonal relationships, material 
      well-being, personal development, self-determination, and social inclusion. 
      CONCLUSION: This review provides a comprehensive relationship between adaptive 
      sports participation and QoL of wheelchair users. This study identifies the value 
      of multi-component interventions and demonstrates the diverse positive influences 
      of adaptive sports on well-being.

TI  - Circadian Rhythm Disruption in Cancer Survivors: From Oncogenesis to Quality of 
      Life.
PG  - e70353
LID - 10.1002/cam4.70353 [doi]
LID - e70353
AB  - BACKGROUND: Circadian rhythms are approximately 24-hour cycles in physiological 
      and behavioral processes. They are entrained to the external solar day via blue 
      wavelength light. Disruptions in these intrinsic rhythms can lead to circadian 
      dysfunction, which has several negative implications on human health, including 
      cancer development and progression. AIMS: Here we review the molecular mechanisms 
      of circadian disruption and their impact on tumor development and progression, 
      discuss the interplay between circadian dysfunction and cancer in basic 
      scientific studies and clinical data, and propose the potential clinical 
      implications of these data that may be used to improve patient outcomes and 
      reduce cost of treatment. MATERIALS & METHODS: Using scientific literature 
      databases, relevant studies were analyzed to draw overarching conclusions of the 
      relationship between circadian rhythm dysruption and cancer. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Circadian disruption can be mediated by a number of environmental factors such as 
      exposure to light at night, shift work, jetlag, and social jetlag which drive 
      oncogenesis. Tumor growth and progression, as well as treatment, can lead to 
      long-term alterations in circadian rhythms that negatively affect quality of life 
      in cancer survivors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been associated with 
      various health implications, including potential effects on oral health and Oral 
      Health-Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL). Understanding the relationship between 
      COPD and dental health is crucial for optimizing patient care and well-being. 
      This review aims to assess the existing literature on the impact of COPD on oral 
      health and OHRQoL. METHODS: The review process followed the Preferred Reporting 
      Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A 
      comprehensive search was conducted in the databases, resulting in 304 records. 
      Data extraction was done by 2 reviewers separately. Data extraction variables 
      included study ID, sample, age, gender ratio, type of study, respiratory 
      evaluation, OHRQoL assessment, and inferences. Newcastle Ottawa scale was 
      employed to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. RESULTS: 
      The final selection included 3 studies eligible for qualitative synthesis. OHIP-5 
      and OHIP-14 were used to assess OHRQoL These studies provided valuable insights 
      into the association between COPD and dental health. OHRQoL was negatively 
      impacted among COPD sufferers. In addition, COPD patients demonstrated 
      significantly fewer teeth and higher plaque index (PI) as compared to control 
      cohorts. The risk of bias was low in the included studies. But the literature 
      available was scarce, which warrants further longitudinal studies with a larger 
      sample size in this regard. CONCLUSION: The evidence from the selected studies 
      suggests a significant association between COPD and various dental health 
      parameters, as well as their impact on OHRQoL. Dental health assessments should 
      be integrated into COPD management to better understand disease severity and 
      exacerbation risk. An interdisciplinary approach involving both respiratory and 
      oral health professionals is crucial for comprehensive patient care. Future 
      research should explore the underlying mechanisms and conduct longitudinal 
      studies to establish causal relationships. These findings contribute to our 
      understanding of the complex interplay between COPD and oral health and have 
      implications for improving patient outcomes and quality of life.

      and vice versa. The impact of oral and general health on individuals can be 
      comprehensively captured by the concepts oral and general health-related quality 
      of life (OHRQoL and HRQoL), respectively. This systematic review and 
      meta-analysis aimed to synthesize existing evidence on the correlation between 
      OHRQoL and HRQoL across different adult populations. METHODS: A comprehensive 
      search strategy was executed across 6 databases (Ovid MEDLINE(R), Embase, CINAHL, 
      APA PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, and Scopus). The search included 
      studies measuring OHRQoL with the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP) and HRQoL 
      with a variety of generic patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Studies were 
      included if they reported correlations between OHRQoL and HRQoL summary scores in 
      adult populations across dental, medical, or nonpatient settings. If a study 
      examined more than one population, each correlation was included for independent 
      analysis. Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted by independent 
      reviewers, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. Random effects 
      meta-analysis was used to summarize the OHRQoL-HRQoL correlations. RESULTS: From 
      10 studies, 13 populations (N=6,053 participants) were included in the analysis. 
      The correlation between general health and oral health-related quality of life 
      was of medium size (r=0.41, 95% CI: 0.32-0.50) with high heterogeneity across 
      populations (I(2)=95%). Results were not unduly influenced by individual 
      populations, study quality, or publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: The correlation 
      between oral health and general health is of medium size, highlighting the 
      potential for medical-dental integration to enhance patient and community health 
      outcomes.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing-and-remitting, potentially 
      progressive form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with multidimensional and 
      often negative effects on patients' lives. Fecal urgency, the sudden and 
      compelling desire to defecate, often accompanied by impaired bowel control 
      leading to frequent and urgent trips to the bathroom, is a distressing symptom, 
      experienced by more than 50% of patients with UC.(1) Physicians frequently 
      underestimate the burden of fecal urgency on patients' lives, with ramifications 
      ranging from disruption in daily activities, social interactions, and emotional 
      distress with resultant impairment in quality of life (QoL).(2,3).

TI  - Parental perspectives on oral health-related quality of life in children and 
      adolescents with autism spectrum disorder: A systematic review.
PG  - 700-718
LID - 10.1111/scd.12951 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) face unique challenges 
      related to oral health, which can negatively impact their day-to-day lives, 
      significantly compromising their overall quality of life. Primary caregivers of 
      children with ASD have a critical role in delivering and seeking oral health 
      care. Hence, it is vital to study their perspective towards their children's oral 
      health and its impact on their quality of life. AIM: To explore the parental 
      perception of oral health-related quality of life in children with autism. 
      METHODS: A systematic electronic and manual search was conducted in Medline (via 
      PubMed), Embase, Google Scholar, Scopus, and LILACS of articles published from 
      January 2003 to May 2023 using appropriate MeSH terms, keywords, and other terms. 
      A four-phase study selection process was followed according to PRISMA guidelines, 
      and data extraction and synthesis were performed using an extraction form. The 
      selected studies were critically appraised using the QATSDD and Crombie's 
      assessment tool. The inter-reviewer agreement was assessed using the kappa with a 
      linear weighting coefficient. RESULTS: Out of the 885 results, 15 studies were 
      included in the review after the two selection phases, and the study 
      characteristics were summarized in tabular form. Study quality varied 
      considerably, and out of a total possible QATSDD score of 42, scores for the 
      individual studies ranged from 14 to 40. The risk of bias for the seven criteria 
      was found to be low. CONCLUSION: The parental perception of the OHRQoL in 
      children with ASD is poor, and the most significant perceived impact is on the 
      child's functional and social well-being aspects. Parental-Caregiver Perception 
      Questionnaire was the most commonly used. The most frequent symptoms include bad 
      breath, food lodgment, mouth breathing and night grinding. The familial impact 
      and influence on the OHRQoL of siblings were also studied.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: As the older adult population increases, hospitals treat more older 
      adults with injuries. After leaving, these patients suffer from decreased 
      mobility and independence, relying on care from others. Family members often 
      assume this responsibility, mostly informally and unpaid. Caregivers of other 
      older adult populations have increased stress and decreased caregiver-related 
      quality of life (CRQoL). Validated CRQoL measures are essential to capture their 
      unique experiences. Our objective was to review existing CRQoL measures and their 
      validity in caregivers of older adult trauma patients. METHODS: A professional 
      librarian searched published literature from the inception of databases through 
      August 12, 2022 in MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase (via Elsevier), and CINAHL 
      Complete (via EBSCO). We identified 1063 unique studies of CRQoL in caregivers 
      for adults with injury and performed a systematic review following 
      COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments 
      guidelines for CRQoL measures. RESULTS: From the 66 studies included, we 
      identified 54 health-related quality-of-life measures and 60 domains capturing 
      caregiver-centered concerns. The majority (83%) of measures included six or fewer 
      CRQoL content domains. Six measures were used in caregivers of older adults with 
      single-system injuries. There were no validated CRQoL measures among caregivers 
      of older adult trauma patients with multisystem injuries. CONCLUSIONS: While many 
      measures exist to assess healthcare-related quality of life, few, if any, 
      adequately assess concerns among caregivers of older adult trauma patients. We 
      found that CRQoL domains, including mental health, emotional health, social 
      functioning, and relationships, are most commonly assessed among caregivers. 
      Future measures should focus on reliability and validity in this specific 
      population to guide interventions.

AB  - The article provides a brief overview of quality of life in patients with 
      lymphoedema and expands on specific aspects of living with the condition, such as 
      physical, emotional and social impacts. Lymphoedema has an impact on body image 
      and mental health, which put the responsibility on healthcare professionals to 
      assist the patient in dealing with the emotional and psychological aspects of 
      lymphoedema. Managing the symptoms and using the best-suited compression garments 
      is essential to improve overall health-related quality of life. The authors 
      suggests methods and ways for clinicians and nurses to help their patients in all 
      areas of lymphoedema management.

TI  - The Implications of Sanctions on Civilian Mental Health and Quality of life 
      Iranian: An overview.
PG  - 170-181
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Islamic Republic of Iran has been under sanctions since 1979. 
      These sanctions were further reinforced between the years 2005 and 2012. This 
      study utilizes available data from Iran post-sanctions to review the impact of 
      economic sanctions on both the mental health and the quality of life of Iranian 
      citizens. METHODS: A comprehensive scoping review was conducted to identify 
      studies examining the impact of sanctions on health in Iran. Searches were 
      initiated in 2012 using PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and the 
      Scientific Information Database (Iranian Database) with keywords such as 
      sanctions, implications, mental health, quality of life, civilian mental health, 
      and Iran. Subsequent to the screening process, secondary reports and letters to 
      the editor were excluded. Only original studies-those collecting data via 
      observation, interviews, surveys, experiments, or literature reviews-were 
      retained for analysis. In addition to these search strategies, reference scanning 
      was undertaken to identify additional articles pertinent to the scope of the 
      current study. This thorough approach facilitated the discovery of relevant and 
      significant articles exploring the effects of sanctions against Iran on the 
      mental health and overall well-being of its civilian population. Following the 
      search, duplicate articles were meticulously identified and removed by the 
      authors. Data were subsequently extracted and summarized, focusing on study 
      characteristics and the observed effects of sanctions on civilian mental health 
      and quality of life in Iran. RESULT: Out of 165 items identified in the 
      preliminary search, ten articles met the inclusion criteria. These selected 
      articles highlighted the pronounced effects of sanctions on various 
      health-related domains. CONCLUSION: Since 2012, Iran has been subject to 
      intensified sanctions. There is evidence to suggest that the economic sanctions, 
      imposed by Western nations, and have exerted a negative and detrimental impact on 
      the health of individual Iranians.

TI  - A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Impairment and Quality of Life in 
      Children and Adolescents with Anxiety Disorders.
PG  - 342-356
LID - 10.1007/s10567-024-00484-5 [doi]
AB  - Anxiety disorders are common, emerge during childhood, and pose a significant 
      burden to society and individuals. Research evaluating the impact of anxiety on 
      functional impairment and quality of life (QoL) is increasing; however, there is 
      yet to be a systematic review and meta-analysis of these relationships in 
      pediatric samples. This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to 
      determine the extent of impairments in functioning and QoL that young people with 
      anxiety disorders experience relative to their healthy peers, as well as 
      sociodemographic and clinical moderators of these relationships. Studies were 
      included when they compared young people (mean age range within studies 
      7-17 years) with a primary clinical anxiety disorder to a healthy comparison 
      group and measured impairment and/or QoL via a validated instrument. A total of 
      12 studies met criteria for this review (N = 3,129 participants). A majority of 
      studies (K = 9) assessed impairment as an outcome measure, and three assessed QoL 
      outcomes. Meta-analysis of nine studies (N = 1,457 children) showed large 
      relationships between clinical anxiety and life impairment (g = 3.23) with the 
      strongest effects seen for clinician report (g = 5.00), followed by caregiver 
      (g = 2.15) and child (g = 1.58) report. The small number of studies and diversity 
      in methodology prevented quantitative investigation of moderating factors. In the 
      systematic review of QoL outcomes, all three studies reported significantly 
      poorer QoL for youth with anxiety disorders relative to unaffected peers. 
      Findings support the importance of measuring functioning and QoL as outcomes in 
      clinical research and practice among anxious young people.This study is 
      registered with PROSPERO under the identification number CRD42023439040.

TI  - Comparative Impact of Integrated Palliative Care vs. Standard Care on the Quality 
      of Life in Cancer Patients: A Global Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 
      Randomized Controlled Trials.
PG  - e0321586
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0321586 [doi]
AB  - IntroductionCancer is a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality, 
      significantly impairing patients' quality of life (QoL). Integrated Palliative 
      Care (IPC) has been proposed as a holistic approach to enhance quality of life by 
      addressing patients' physical, emotional, and psychosocial needs. While some 
      studies suggest Integrated Palliative Care improves quality of life more than 
      standard care, the evidence remains inconclusive. This systematic review and 
      meta-analysis aim to evaluate the comparative impact of Integrated Palliative 
      Care versus standard care on the quality of life in cancer patients. MethodsA 
      comprehensive search of databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase 
      was conducted. We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 
      Integrated Palliative Care and standard care for cancer patients, focusing on the 
      quality of life as measured by validated tools such as the EORTC QLQ-C30 and 
      FACT-G. Data were pooled using a random-effects model to account for study 
      heterogeneity. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also performed. ResultsNine 
      randomized controlled trials involving 1,794 patients met the inclusion criteria. 
      Meta-analysis showed that Integrated Palliative Care significantly improved 
      quality of life compared to standard care (SMD = 3.25; 95% CI: 1.20-5.30; p < 
      0.001). Studies conducted in Asia showed the highest standardized mean difference 
      (SMD = 6.15; 95% CI: 3.07-9.23; p < 0.001), followed closely by studies from 
      Africa (SMD = 6.0; 95% CI: 5.13-6.87; p < 0.001), compared to those from other 
      regions. Similarly, research focusing on lung cancer patients showed the greatest 
      standardized mean difference of (SMD = 6.15; 95% CI: 3.07-9.23; p < 0.001) 
      relative to other cancer types. Furthermore, studies involving newly diagnosed 
      cancer patients recorded the highest standardized mean difference of (SMD = 5.69; 
      95% CI: 4.57-6.80; p < 0.001). ConclusionIntegrated Palliative Care significantly 
      enhances the quality of life in cancer patients compared to standard care. These 
      findings support integrating Integrated Palliative Care into oncology practices 
      to provide comprehensive, patient-centered care that addresses both physical and 
      emotional needs. Further research should explore long-term benefits across 
      diverse populations.

TI  - Using Virtual Reality to Improve Outcomes Related to Quality of Life Among Older 
      Adults With Serious Illnesses: Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials.
PG  - e54452
LID - 10.2196/54452 [doi]
LID - e54452
AB  - BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) has promise as an innovative nonpharmacologic 
      treatment for improving a patient's quality of life. VR can be used as an adjunct 
      or treatment for many acute and chronic conditions, including serious illnesses. 
      OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to assess the current state of the 
      literature of randomized controlled trials that use VR in patients with serious 
      illnesses. Two secondary aims include assessing intervention components 
      associated with improved quality of life and functional outcomes among older 
      adults, as well as evaluating how well the randomized controlled trials adhere to 
      consensus standards for VR research. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and 
      CINAHL for randomized controlled studies published at any time. We screened and 
      accepted studies that reported outcomes related to patients' quality of life, 
      provided an immersive VR intervention, and included patients with serious 
      illness. We narratively summarized key attributes of publications that shed light 
      on study efficacy, generalizability, replicability, and clinical utility. All 
      studies were assessed for study quality with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and 
      for concordance with 8 recent consensus standards for VR research. RESULTS: From 
      the 12,621 articles searched in May 2024, a total of 24 (0.19%) studies met the 
      inclusion criteria, and of these, 88% (21/24) reported an improvement in at least 
      1 patient quality of life outcome and 67% (16/24) had a high risk of bias. In 7 
      (n=24, 29%) studies, VR was used to provide distraction therapy to reduce pain. 
      In total, 5 (n=24, 21%) studies included training, supervision, and assistance in 
      VR use, which demonstrated improvements in patient quality of life-related 
      outcomes. Of 24 studies, 9 (38%) included patients with stroke, 9 (38%) included 
      patients with cancer, 4 (17%) included patients with cardiovascular disease, 1 
      (4%) included patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 1 (4%) 
      included patients who reported pain in hospital. In all 9 studies that included 
      patients with stroke, the main purpose of VR was to improve mobility and 
      strength; these studies had higher frequency and longer durations of VR use, 
      ranging from 2 to 9 weeks, as compared to a VR use duration of <2 weeks for 
      studies aiming to reduce pain or anxiety. Regarding consensus standards for VR 
      research, 29% (7/24) of the studies adhered to all 8 criteria, and all studies 
      (24/24, 100%) adhered to ≥5 criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Nascent evidence suggests VR's 
      potential in mitigating pain, anxiety, and depression and improving mobility 
      among persons with serious illnesses. Most studies did not provide detailed 
      information about unassisted or assisted use, suggesting that VR for older adults 
      is currently most appropriate for observed settings with assistance available.

TI  - Types of Home and Community-Based Physical Activity and Their Effects on the 
      Older Adults' Quality of Life: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 1950-1967
LID - 10.1177/07334648241257799 [doi]
AB  - Home and community-based physical activity (HCBPA) has been extensively utilized 
      among older adults. Nevertheless, the varying types of HCBPA, including different 
      duration, intensity, and frequency, have sparked controversy regarding their 
      impact on the quality of life in older adults. This study aims to explore the 
      effects of HCBPA on QoL in older adults. We conducted a systematic review and 
      retrieved studies published from January 2000 to April 2023 from multiple 
      databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and the Web of Science Library). Seventeen 
      articles met the inclusion criteria for this study. Long-term HCBPA interventions 
      may have a more pronounced positive impact on older adults' quality of life than 
      short-term ones, with the intervention's intensity and frequency playing a key 
      role in its effectiveness. The results of the meta-analyses showed significant 
      differences in PCS but not in MCS, both with low certainty of evidence. 
      Policymakers should prioritize the importance of promoting HCBPA interventions 
      with appropriate duration, intensity, and frequency to create a more 
      age-inclusive society.

TI  - Enhancing cancer care through addressing a neglected pillar: a narrative review 
      on quality of life in Pakistani patients.
PG  - 1836-1842
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.11099 [doi]
AB  - The current narrative review was planned to evaluate the quality of life of 
      Pakistani cancer patients. Using relevant questionnaires and comparing global 
      data over the last 2 decades, the review planned to explore artificial 
      intelligence's role in cancer care, and to develop strategies for better 
      outcomes. The review yielded poor results and exposed huge and neglected gaps in 
      the overall approach towards the management of cancer patients based on different 
      tumour types and categories. A few experimental interventions demonstrated 
      promising results and echoed the need for further clinical and non-clinical 
      experimentation for negating poor quality of life outcomes. Unsurprisingly, not a 
      single study in the literature analysed, revealed a positive quality of life. A 
      multi-pronged approach, therefore, must be brainstormed and safely implemented 
      through experimentation of artificial intelligence and active coordination among 
      healthcare bodies, finance/economic boards and welfare organisations that are 
      active in countries like Pakistan to uplift the neglected quality of life domain 
      among cancer patients, especially breast and oral cancers that have the highest 
      incidences worldwide.

AB  - Low-carbohydrate diets (LCD) have inconclusive impacts on psychological outcomes, 
      quality of life (QoL), and cognition. This study summarised current evidence by 
      searching PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Sciences until October 2024. Thirty 
      randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included with a total sample size of 
      1781 (923 in the LCD group and 853 in the control group). No significant effect 
      of LCD on mood disturbance, depression, anxiety, QoL, or memory speed was found. 
      Subgroup analysis, however, showed significant QoL improvement in subjects 
      consuming ≥15% of energy from carbohydrate, and trials with follow-up over 
      120 days. Of note, LCD significantly increased QoL in patients with neurological 
      disorders. However, an unfavourable decrease in memory speed was observed in 
      adults older than 55 years, and those consuming ≥15% of energy from carbohydrate. 
      Findings demonstrated contradictory effects of LCD on QoL, mood, mental health, 
      and memory speed. STUDY REGISTRATION: CRD42023452217.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the most important factors shaping 
      the quality of life in a social care institution from the clients' perspective. 
      This study examines factors beyond direct care that affect the quality of life 
      for clients in social care institutions, focusing on Riga Municipality's Social 
      Care Center "Gailezers". Structured interviews with 95 clients assessed six 
      domains: autonomy, relationships, activities, environment, food, and care 
      quality. This study emphasizes the need to align services with clients' views to 
      enhance their well-being. Based on the results, this study aimed to develop 
      practical proposals for adjusting the content and organization of social care 
      services to better align with the clients' understanding of the factors affecting 
      their quality of life in the institution.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) usually 
      have a decreased quality of life (QOL). Specialized questionnaires on QOL may be 
      more sensitive when studying individual issues of COPD therapy than general 
      (universal) questionnaires. GOAL: Conducting a review of specific tools for 
      assessing the quality of life of patients with COPD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 
      study was carried out based on the results of a search of scientific literature 
      presented in the bibliographic databases PubMed (USA) and ELIBRARY.RU (Russia, 
      Russian-language sources). Keywords were used to search for relevant sources: 
      «quality of life», «COPD», «chronic obstructive pulmonary disease» etc. In order 
      to search for information on individual questionnaires, queries containing the 
      names of the questionnaires were used. Additional references were obtained using 
      the search engines Google and Yandex. RESULTS: Based on the results of a study of 
      the scientific literature and a search in the PubMed / Medline information base, 
      22 specific tests used to assess the quality of life of patients with COPD were 
      considered. These tests demonstrate different relevance and scientific 
      applicability in recent years. Five tests were most often used in foreign and 
      domestic studies: St. George respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ), the COPD 
      assessment test (CAT), the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale 
      (mMRC), the chronic respiratory questionnaire (CRQ), the clinical COPD 
      questionnaire (CCQ). CONCLUSION: Further study as well as local adaptation (if so 
      required) of some questionnaires will open up new opportunities for their wider 
      implementation into the routine daily practice of providing medical care to 
      patients with COPD in the regions.

AB  - The article examines the socio-demographic aspects of managing the quality of 
      life of the population in modern conditions. The standard of living of the 
      population is a complex socio-economic parameter that reflects the combined 
      impact of various factors on the nature of the consumer ability of citizens and 
      the ability to maintain a certain lifestyle. Globalization processes in the 
      global economy increase interest in the problem of effective management of the 
      standard of living of the population, since the indicators used to assess the 
      quality of life of the population characterize the development of socio-economic 
      relations in the state. In conclusion, it is concluded that the category «quality 
      of life of the population» is an important indicator of the effectiveness of 
      public management of socio-demographic processes, and demographic processes are 
      one of the key factors in the indicator of the quality of life of the population.

TI  - Exploring the role of health-related quality of life measures in predictive 
      modelling for oncology: a systematic review.
PG  - 305-323
LID - 10.1007/s11136-024-03820-y [doi]
AB  - Health related quality of life (HRQoL) is increasingly assessed in oncology 
      research and routine care, which has led to the inclusion of HRQoL in prediction 
      models. This review aims to describe the current state of oncological prediction 
      models incorporating HRQoL. A systematic literature search for the inclusion of 
      HRQoL in prediction models in oncology was conducted. Selection criteria were a 
      longitudinal study design and inclusion of HRQoL data in prediction models as 
      predictor, outcome, or both. Risk of bias was assessed using the PROBAST tool and 
      quality of reporting was scored with an adapted TRIPOD reporting guideline. From 
      4747 abstracts, 98 records were included in this review. High risk of bias was 
      found in 71% of the publications. HRQoL was mainly incorporated as predictor (78% 
      (55% predictor only, 23% both predictor and outcome)), with physical functioning 
      and symptom domains selected most frequently as predictor. Few models (23%) 
      predicted HRQoL domains by other or baseline HRQoL domains. HRQoL was used as 
      outcome in 21% of the publications, with a focus on predicting symptoms. There 
      were no difference between AI-based (16%) and classical methods (84%) in model 
      type selection or model performance when using HRQoL data. This review highlights 
      the role of HRQoL as a tool in predicting disease outcomes. Prediction of and 
      with HRQoL is still in its infancy as most of the models are not fully developed. 
      Current models focus mostly on the physical aspects of HRQoL to predict clinical 
      outcomes, and few utilize AI-based methods.

TI  - Is Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Effective in Improving Quality of 
      Life?: A Systematic Review.
PG  - E126-E135
LID - 10.1097/JCN.0000000000001007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis (AS) without surgical intervention is associated with 
      morbidity and mortality and is the most common valvular disease in the western 
      world. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a minimally invasive 
      surgical option that has become a common treatment for people unable to undergo 
      open aortic valve replacement; despite the increase in TAVI offerings in the last 
      decade, patient quality of life (QoL) outcomes postoperatively are poorly 
      understood. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to determine whether TAVI is 
      effective in improving QoL. METHOD: A systematic review following Preferred 
      Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines was 
      conducted, and the protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42019122753). MEDLINE, 
      CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were searched for studies published between 2008 and 
      2021. Search terms included "transcatheter aortic valve replacement" and "quality 
      of life" and their synonyms. Included studies were evaluated, dependent on study 
      design, using either the Risk of Bias-2 or the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Seventy 
      studies were included in the review. RESULTS: Authors of the studies used a wide 
      variety of QoL assessment instruments and follow-up durations; authors of most 
      studies identified an improvement in QoL, and a small number identified a decline 
      in QoL or no change from baseline. CONCLUSION: Although authors of the vast 
      majority of studies identified an improvement in QoL, there was very little 
      consistency in instrument choice or follow-up duration; this made analysis and 
      comparison difficult. A consistent approach to measuring QoL for patients who 
      undergo TAVI is needed to enable comparison of outcomes. A richer, more nuanced 
      understanding of QoL outcomes after TAVI could help clinicians support patient 
      decision making and evaluate outcomes.

AB  - Dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, has significant impacts on patients' quality 
      of life. A thorough history and physical examination can provide important 
      information to determine if dysphagia is originating from oropharyngeal or 
      esophageal causes. Identifying the underlying pathology contributing to dysphagia 
      allows for optimal treatment and improved quality of life.

AB  - Measuring health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is important because it can 
      serve as an indicator or a predictor of subsequent mortality or morbidity. HRQoL 
      has been shown to be directly related to child growth and development and 
      indirectly related to the healthcare costs of young children. Existing measures 
      of HRQoL in children have heavily relied on traditional questionnaires that use 
      age-suited versions or parent proxy questionnaires. However, both of these 
      methods may present with different types of biases and may misrepresent 
      underlying HRQoL. The current mini reivew will first illustrate these 
      methodological limitations and highlight the potential use of pictorial scales in 
      addition to discussing their suitability for specifically measuring HRQoL as an 
      alternative. We will also synthesize existing recommendations on the development 
      of pictorial scales to provide a protocol as a recommendation to researchers who 
      are aiming to develop an overall HRQoL pictorial scale that is suited for 
      children.

TI  - Impact of Clinical Consequences of Pulp Involvement due to Caries on Oral 
      Health-Related Quality of Life in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review 
      and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 71-84
LID - 10.1159/000541027 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dental caries with pulp involvement potentially impacts the oral 
      health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate 
      whether clinical consequences of pulp involvement due to dental caries impacts 
      OHRQoL of children and adolescents. METHODS: Observational studies evaluating 
      whether children/adolescents (population) with pulp involvement due to caries 
      (exposition) compared with those without it (comparison) have more negative 
      impact on their OHRQoL (outcome) were included. A systematic search was 
      undertaken in August 2022 in seven databases. Alerts were set until August 2023. 
      JBI Critical Appraisal tool for cross-sectional studies was used for 
      methodological quality assessment. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to 
      calculate mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) of impact 
      on OHRQoL. For studies with dichotomous outcome, meta-analysis calculated the 
      odds ratio (OR). Robustness, heterogeneity, certainty of evidence, and 
      publication bias were evaluated. RESULTS: From 29 included studies, 14 assessed 
      preschoolers, nine assessed schoolchildren, four assessed adolescents, and two 
      assessed children/adolescents. PUFA was the main index used to assess the 
      exposure. ECOHIS (preschoolers) and CPQ (children/adolescents) were the main 
      tools used to assess the outcome. Only five articles fully adhered to the quality 
      criteria. The meta-analyses found the following main results: (a) preschoolers: 
      MD -10.79 (-16.50; -5.09); (b) schoolchildren: MD -5.12 (-7.51; -2.72); (c) 
      adolescents: MD -1.86 (-4.59; 0.87); (d) overall impact: SMD -2.18; (CI: 
      -3.21;-1.15) and OR 0.52 (CI: 0.30; 0.90). CONCLUSION: Pulp involvement impacted 
      OHRQoL of children negatively. In adolescents, this impact was not observed. 
      Results must be interpreted with caution due to very low certainty of evidence.

TI  - Comparing the EORTC QLQ-LC13, EORTC QLQ-LC29, and the FACT-L for assessment of 
      quality of life in patients with lung cancer - an updated systematic review.
PG  - 260-268
LID - 10.1097/SPC.0000000000000725 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Two commonly used quality of life (QoL) questionnaires in lung 
      cancer patients are the European Organization for Research and Treatment of 
      Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer 13 (QLQ-LC13) and the 
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung (FACT-L). More recently, the EORTC 
      QLQ-LC29 was developed. This systematic review compares the EORTC QLQ-LC29, EORTC 
      QLQ-LC13 and FACT-L in terms of the content, validity and psychometric properties 
      in assessing the QoL of lung cancer patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Fourteen studies 
      were included. The EORTC QLQ-LC29 is a 29-item scale that serves as an update of 
      the EORTC QLQ-LC13 to include symptoms from surgery and new targeted therapies. 
      It shows validity, high internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and 
      sensitivity. The FACT-L continues to assess general quality of life and lung 
      cancer-specific symptoms. SUMMARY: The EORTC QLQ-LC29, EORTC QLQ-LC13, and FACT-L 
      were reviewed to assess their validity in measuring QoL of lung cancer patients. 
      All were found to be sufficiently validated, The choice of which to use should 
      depend on the primary goals of the study.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The high demands and current working conditions of nursing 
      professionals who work in intensive care units' impact both their quality of life 
      and their intention to rotate, and these in turn impact the quality of care. 
      OBJECTIVE: Identify the relationship between quality of Work Life (QWL) and the 
      intention to rotate and/or leave the organization of nursing profession in 
      intensive care units. METHOD: Analytical cross-sectional observational study with 
      101 nursing professionals (NP) working in adult intensive care with more than one 
      year of experience in the area. Simple random probabilistic sampling - 51NP and 
      non-probabilistic convenience sampling - 50NP. The Quality of Life at Work - CVT 
      GOHISALO instrument is applied plus five questions on turnover intention and 
      other sociodemographic questions. The exploratory statistical analysis considered 
      frequency tables and Chi square measures of association to develop the Logit 
      model with the CVT variable as the exposure and the intention to rotate as the 
      outcome. RESULTS: The dimensions of Quality of Life at Work that show the 
      greatest dissatisfaction are integration with work - D3 (61%), job satisfaction - 
      D4 (72%), personal development - D6 (67%) and free time management - D7 (75%). 
      There is a high intention to change to another institution (57%) and to migrate 
      to another country (63%). The intention to change to another institution can be 
      explained by job satisfaction and institutional support (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: 
      There is an inverse relationship between satisfaction with the dimensions of 
      quality of life at work and the intention to change to another service, 
      institution, or independent work, which would imply developing strategies that 
      improve CVT to reduce the intention to rotate.
